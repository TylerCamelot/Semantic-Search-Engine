While I\nhaven't used the original HTVRONT Auto Heat Press, the Auto 2 has several more features, like\nadjustable pressure, a wider heat range, and a few small design changes.\nThe Auto 2 is a 1,500-watt, 15 x 15-inch (38 x 38-cm) automatic heat press that does the pressing for\nyou once you plug in your parameters. Load your drawer, slide it in, and the machine can automatically\nclamp down and run its cycle. No lever pulling, no guessing how hard, not even any extra button\npushes. It might sound lazy, but it's surprisingly convenient when you're crunching out items back to\nback to back.\nHTVRONT Automatic Heat Press 2- Digital Press, Real Ease\nCompared to my old clamshell press, this feels like a solid upgrade, not that my Panda press is at all\nbad. This is just better! The menu makes it easy to dial in time (from 1 to 999 seconds), temperature\n(up to about 410 °F / 210 °C), and pressure (44 lb to 170 lb / 20 to 80 kg) depending on what you're\nworking with. There are even four custom memory functions for swapping between your preferred\nsettings when switching from DTF, HTV vinyl, sublimation, and other transfer types.\nPressing custom New Atlas apparel is as easy as pie. Actually, now that I'm thinking about it, I don't\nknow how to make pie, so this is easier than pie JS @ New Atlas\nI've gone so far as to purposely misalign shirts when pressing, like pressing near edges instead of dead\ncenter, just to see if heat and pressure held up evenly across the platen. And 100+ presses later, so far\nso good. Most of my work has been DTF, but I've also run cut vinyl transfers, and everything has come\nout clean. I may have even used it to iron out a few wrinkles in a pinch.\nThe Auto 2 heats up pretty quickly – usually about 3-4 minutes before getting me up to my usual 305 °F\n(152.8 °C), so you won't be waiting too long to get to pressin'. And if you forget to turn it off, it'll auto-off\nafter 15 minutes of inactivity for you. HTVRONT says it'll heat up to 410 °F in five-and-a-half minutes,\nbut I haven't needed to go full scorched-earth on anything yet, so I've not put that stat to the test. And\nas far as I can tell, it maintains your desired temp really well without fluctuating.\nThere are a couple minor quirks that are more of an annoyance than a real flaw: more often than not,\nthe Teflon sheet will stick to the platen when it lifts – I'm guessing it's probably just static. It just means I\nhave to give it a gentle tug, or it'll fall off on its own after a few seconds, but annoyingly to the side and\noff my bench, forcing me to chase after it. And every now and again, a koozie might stick to the platen if\nI don't use a Teflon sheet on top of it. I keep a wooden paint stirring stick next to the machine to poke\nanything that might get stuck, just in case.\nThick hoodies can also be a little tricky. While the press has plenty of height between the platen and\ntray to handle thicker items (1.77 inches / 4.5 cm), its rear clearance could use a little work when sliding\nthe tray in. Toward the back, where the hood and extra fabric hang off the tray, the fabric will bunch up\non you. Space gets a little tight in general if you're doing a large design on a large shirt, making it a little\nmore difficult to keep your project aligned.\nWith the tray slid out, and looking at the rear area from the left, you can see how there's not a ton of\nspace back there for extra fabric, like hoods on hoodies. I'd like to see that opened up a bit more JS @\nNew Atlas\nAnother thing worth noting is the press mechanism itself. I didn't see any warning stickers suggesting\nnot to stick an arm or a leg in there while pressing, but common sense advises against it. As far as I\ncan tell, there are no obstruction sensors or an automatic safety release on the press. Should a fleshy\nbit become stuck in the press, your only option is pressing the manual \"R\" button to interrupt the timer\nand raise the press, which isn't going to happen as fast as you'd prefer in that situation. So far, in 100+\npresses, I haven't even come close to burning myself.\nPhysically, the Auto 2 has a nice, little, compact, rectangular footprint, so it doesn't take up all your\nworkspace. The slide-out drawer helps keep it compact when not in use and makes loading easy when\nyou're going full tilt. Even the display screen tilts forward. Not a feature I really use, but I can see\nsomeone appreciating it, depending on their setup. It feels like it was designed by someone who's\npressed a whole lot of shirts in their day and knows exactly what features this auto press needs, and\nwhich it doesn't.\nThe Auto 2 is 20.9 inches deep, 17.1 wide, and 13 inches tall (53 × 43.5 × 33 cm), making it pretty\ncompact overall. Pictured to the right is my DTF oven that I also reviewed JS @ New Atlas\nThat being said, I do wish it were just a tad bit bigger – after all, I do live in Texas, where the average\nhuman, myself included, isn't average-sized, so I'm often working in 2XL territory – but that's where\npress prices jump into a totally different tier. But as it sits, it's a solid choice for hobbyists who love\nmaking things at home. And perhaps even for a small custom apparel business, I'd say, but if you're\ncrunching out hundreds of items per day, stick to an industrial press, for sure.\nThis US$350 machine punches out presses about as fast as you're ever going to get outside of an\nassembly line, it's versatile, and arguably most important, it's consistent. Oh yeah, and mine is purple –\nbut they have white and blue too, if you're not a cool guy like me. It has 4.5 stars at Amazon on 880\nreviews at the time of writing, so it looks like others agree with my thoughts that it works as advertised.\nIt looks like HTVRONT is having a Valentine's Day sale as well.\nProduct Page: HTVRONT\nNew Atlas may receive commission on purchases through our links.

These disputes are now\ndisrupting major outdoor events and turning dream occasions into nightmares for organisers.\nADEKUNLE SULAIMON reports\nShe sat with her hands folded, fingers interlaced as she gathered her thoughts. When Adeyanju\nRebecca began to speak, her voice was softer than one might expect from someone of her professional\nstanding.\nIt lacked the usual assurance associated with her name and résumé. Instead, it was measured and\nreflective, shaped by a difficult experience. This was not the voice of the Head of Product at Block\nParty, a subsidiary of Mainland Block Party, Island Block Party, and Capital Block Party, but that of a\nprofessional recalling a challenging moment that tested years of work and reputation.\nAdeyanju is familiar with fast-paced environments. With over five years in event management, she has\ndelivered major entertainment projects. In addition to Block Party, she collaborates with The Plug, a\nfull-service entertainment and culture agency based in Lagos State, managing well-known figures such\nas Davido, Victony, Israel Adesanya, and Tobi Amusan. These are clients with high standards and little\nroom for error, where attention to detail is essential.\nThat is why the December incident remained on her mind. She chose not to disclose the name of the\nshow or the vendor involved. The decision was intentional. Revisiting the specifics would reopen an\nuncomfortable moment and acknowledge that an event under her supervision did not go as planned.\n“Vendors are central to any event,” she explained. “Lighting, sound, screens, technical support, stage; if\none part is delayed, everything else is affected. Agreements are often made ahead of time, but in this\nindustry, trust and past experience also play a big role. Venues are sometimes secured with deposits\nand dates rather than extensive paperwork. Production vendors are engaged because they have\ndelivered before.”\n“There isn’t always time to formalise everything fully,” she added. “You rely on previous results and\nprofessional relationships.”\nShe accepted the vendor’s terms not because of size or reputation alone, but because she trusted their\nprevious work. In her view, reliability should go both ways. If delivery was uncertain, collaboration\nshould not proceed. That had always been her approach. In December, however, things unfolded\ndifferently.\n“The concert was scheduled for 7 pm. Fans arrived early. Tickets were sold out. The artiste was\nprepared, and the brand had fulfilled its responsibilities.\n“But production faced setbacks. The equipment was not ready on time, and technical issues caused\ndelays. What should have been straightforward required extra coordination. Multiple conversations took\nplace as efforts were made to resolve the situation. Eventually, the show began around midnight.”\nAs she spoke, it was clear the delay had a lasting impression on her. The extended wait affected\neveryone involved — the audience, the artiste, and the organisers.\n“What helped in the end was how the situation was handled. The artiste addressed the audience,\nexplained the delay, and performed as planned. He acknowledged the inconvenience and helped\nmaintain the relationship with the fans.”\nAside from Adeyanju, there are a few other event managers who share a similar fate about\ndisappointment with vendors, notable or with low-profile, who have run them into debt due to their\nineptitude and the last-minute failure to provide services that were paid for.\nHeartbroken, but show goes on\nShe admitted she was close to tears, not because of the money spent on the whole show, but because\nof the disappointment.\nAdeyanju noted that the vendor, to their credit, admitted fault. However, the admission did not undo the\ndamage. They agreed to a refund, which she confirmed she had received half of, with the balance\npromised for February.\n“The refund was not a victory; it was a consolation prize for emotional damage already done. Fans\nwere not refunded. The service, technically, was delivered. However, late. The apology stood in place\nof compensation,” she noted.\nAlthough the event manager did not deny that disappointment is part of event planning, she added,\n“Things go wrong. People default. Systems fail. But what saves a brand is trust and track record.\nWithout those, one bad night can erase years of goodwill.\n“Block Party also responds to such situations with statements, apologies, incentives, and added value.\nDamage control is necessary for us in such instances. Survival depends on how quickly you can\nstabilise public perception while privately absorbing the blow.”\nWhat this incident taught her, she said, was emotional restraint; she has learned to harden herself, to\nmove on quickly, to seek alternatives rather than sink into despair, but learning does not erase pain; it\nonly teaches her how to carry it without falling apart in public.\nSpeaking on whether the company outsources jobs to popular vendors to deliver excellently, she\nstressed, “Block Party does not chase big names for outsourcing except where visibility demands it, like\nhiring popular DJs.\n“Otherwise, vendors are chosen based on experience, reliability, and recommendations. This, too, had\nbeen the case in December. And still, it failed. And it pains that there is no association we can report\nmost of these vendors to when situations like this arise, you have to deal with it yourself.”\nWedding imbroglio\nRather than an encounter with a vendor, one man who identified simply as Ikechukwu, an Edo indigene\nwho got married to his wife in 2025, recounted how he lost about N8.5m to an event planner after\nengaging the services of the organiser without proper background checks — a decision he said has left\nhim heartbroken and locked in a legal battle.\nIkechukwu stated that he is currently in court with the event planner after the service delivered fell far\nbelow what was agreed, adding that what he eventually got was “not close to N2 million” in value.\nThe aggrieved man explained that the incident happened while he was based in Canada and planning\nan event in Nigeria, relying solely on video calls and virtual assurances from the planner throughout the\nprocess.\nAccording to him, the planner presented convincing proposals, shared pictures, and made several\npromises that gave him confidence to proceed with the payment.\n“I was in Canada at the time, so everything we did was through video calls,” he said. “From our\ndiscussions, what was presented to me was top-notch. I paid about N8.5m in good faith because I\nwanted the event to be perfect.”\nHowever, Ikechukwu said his expectations were shattered on the day of the event.\n“What I saw on that day broke me. The decoration, the setup, everything was a far cry from what we\nagreed on. Honestly, what was delivered was not even close to N2m in value,” he lamented.\nHe said attempts to resolve the issue amicably failed, leaving him with no option but to seek legal\nredress.\n“I tried to be calm. I called, I complained, I asked for explanations, but I was met with excuses and\nsilence. That was when I realised I had been taken for granted,” he said.\nIkechukwu expressed deep regret over trusting the planner without conducting thorough checks or\nappointing someone on the ground to independently verify the arrangements.\n“I blame myself to a large extent. I should have done proper checks. I should have had someone\nphysically present to monitor things. I learned the hard way,” he said.\nNow in court, Ikechukwu said the experience has been emotionally draining and financially painful, but\nhe hopes others will learn from his ordeal.\n“I don’t want anyone, especially Nigerians in the diaspora, to go through this kind of pain. Don’t just\ntrust sweet words and video calls. Verify, confirm, and do your due diligence,” he warned.\nHe added that while the court case continues, the episode has left a lasting scar and changed his\napproach to trust and business dealings back home.\n“It’s not just about the money. It’s the disappointment and the feeling of being cheated. I only hope\njustice will be served,” he said.\nNo chairs during my wedding — Bride\nFor a bride named Chisom Agwu (not real name), her story was quite hurtful. She got married on 3\nJanuary after her engagement in August. She recalled how the event planners had not completed the\ndecorations in the hall secured for the reception, and the chairs had not yet been arranged.\nShe reminisced about how her husband urged her to remain in the car for hours, raising her suspicions\nabout the availability of the hall.\n“It was after I got tired that I called my friend to tell me the truth about what’s going on? Imagine paying\nabout N5 million to this person. Only to end up with such embarrassing planning. I have not gotten over\nthe experience,” Agwu declared.\n‘Vendor made me lose over N40m deal’\nSpeaking on his experience as event manager, Komolafe Lateef, the founder of an event planning\nbrand based in Lagos, narrated how a production mishap by a hired vendor cost his company a\nsubsequent wedding deal valued at over N40 million.\nThe boss of Komolafe Wedding Events explained that the incident occurred during a high-profile\nwedding ceremony in Lagos, for which his company was solely responsible for planning and\ncoordinating.\nAccording to him, the vendor was contracted to handle the production aspects of the ceremony,\nincluding the sound system, but failed to deliver as agreed, resulting in a disruption that affected the\noverall experience of guests and clients.\nHe stressed that his biggest regret was not entering a formal contractual deal with him, but rather it was\nverbally agreed that he should provide what had been paid for, something Komolafe admitted would\nserve the purpose he was paying for.\nKomolafe said, “We had done our part as planners. The concept, coordination, timelines, and logistics\nwere properly handled. Unfortunately, the vendor in charge of production, especially the sound system,\ndid not deliver what we agreed on.”\nHe explained that the failure became evident at a critical point during the ceremony, leaving little room\nfor immediate correction.\n“At some point, the microphones went off, the sound was inconsistent, and there was confusion during\nkey moments of the programme. For a wedding, those moments are very important. You cannot afford\nto get them wrong,” he said.\nThe wedding planner noted that although the couple later expressed understanding, the damage to\nperception had already been done.\n“In this line of work, perception is everything. Even when the fault is not directly yours, clients often see\nthe event brand as a whole. They don’t separate the planner from the vendor,” Komolafe stated.\nHe added that the incident later affected his business when a prospective client, who had attended the\nwedding, declined to proceed with a proposed deal.\n“We were in advanced discussions for another wedding that was worth over N40 million. After the\nevent, communication changed. Eventually, it was clear that they felt the wedding did not reflect the\nlevel of competence they were expecting,” he said.\nKomolafe, however, declined to name the vendor involved, noting that the issue had been resolved\namicably.\n“I won’t mention the name of the brand involved because everything has already been settled between\nus. There is no need to reopen wounds or create unnecessary issues,” he said.\nHe used the experience to highlight the importance of thorough vendor vetting and accountability in the\nevents industry, while dismissing the idea of knowing an association in their sector.\n“This experience taught me that as a planner, you must take full responsibility for every vendor you\nbring on board. Even if they come highly recommended, you still need to double-check their capacity\nand preparedness,” Komolafe said.\nNo vendor ever disappointed me\nUnlike Adeyanju and Komolafe, the founder of ‘Headline’, a concept production company, Moyo\nOnipede, said she has never been disappointed by any vendor before.\nShe attributed the success of her events to dissociating from doing deals with third parties, adding that\nshe mostly handles her work directly, except when her staff is handling liaison for her.\nOnipede, who has been in concert production since 2021, said she also handles smaller briefs, such as\nstage management and concert production management, while dabbling in corporate, wedding, and\ngovernment functions.\n“I mostly handle my business directly and not through third parties, except that it is the staff of my\ncompany who are just handling liaison with me. I work with all vendors directly. However, I understand\nthat certain people work with third parties to ensure that the work is successful. I have not had any\ndisappointment from the vendor before. I have vendors I’ve always worked with, most of whom always\ndeliver,” she told our correspondent.\nSpeaking on how she handles contractual terms with hall vendors, the Ibadan-based concert manager,\nknown for organising artiste Bella Shmurda’s shows in the city, noted that she often has preferences\nwhen choosing a hall and always furnishes them with information such as time frames and dates while\nconfirming availability and the payment structure.\nVendors reject blame\nAn event vendor with eight years of experience has pushed back against the claim that vendors are\nresponsible for most event failures, saying the real problems often stem from underpricing, poor\nplanning, and decisions made by event managers or hosts.\nSerah Coker, founder of Event by TS, an indoor and outdoor decoration firm based in Lagos, said\nvendors are frequently blamed for issues they did not cause. “Yes, most of the time, I often take events\nthat aren’t quite favourable,” she said, explaining that vendors are often brought in late or under tight\nbudgets.\nAccording to Coker, many vendors do not receive events directly from clients, which increases costs\nand limits flexibility.\n“Most of the time, we don’t get the event directly, which results in extra-cutting costs for the event; this\nreally makes us go with the cheaper vendors to carry out the activities,” she said.\nShe noted that underpricing is a major issue in the industry, forcing vendors to work under difficult\nconditions. Despite these challenges, she said her company protects itself through documentation.\n“We have a written invoice that we are going to bring. Along the line, if anything changes, we would be\nable to refer to them on it with consent approved. So we always have a written agreement, or it is\nbacked up by chats,” Coker explained.\nAddressing the issue of failed events, Coker said responsibility often lies elsewhere. “Sometimes, the\ndecision is made by the event manager responsible for the event.\n“Other times, the event’s mess-up usually comes from the person hosting it.” She added that vendors\nstill end up taking the blame. “But many times, we just apologise for it, even though it didn’t come from\nus,” Coker explained.\nCoker advised event planners to improve coordination to avoid such problems. “I advise that event\nplanners should conduct a back-to-back follow-up or delegate it to someone,” she said.\nShe also distanced herself from industry associations, saying they do not adequately represent\nvendors, while stressing that she is not part of the association because it tends to favour big event\nmanagers and vendors, rather than identify with them as vendors.\n‘Event planners behind floppiness’\nSharing his thoughts, DJ Teewisky, also known as Tolulope Subairu, a disc jockey and sound engineer,\nblamed the growing incidence of failed or poorly executed events on underpayment and excessive\ncost-cutting by event planners.\nHe said many planners ignore professional advice on sound requirements, a situation that often results\nin substandard delivery and public dissatisfaction.\nSubairu explained that planners frequently downplay technical recommendations based on venue size.\n“When you tell them that you will need mixers and maybe about 10 speakers or more due to the size of\nthe hall, most of them would fault it, saying that six will still fit in,” he said, noting that such decisions are\nusually driven by a desire to reduce expenses rather than achieve quality.\nAccording to the sound engineer, performers and technical crews are often unfairly blamed when\nevents turn out poorly, even though they have warned planners in advance.\n“Most of the time, the sloppiness of an event or concert largely does not come from us but from the\nevent planner. Their handedness is a major concern, and they know all these things,” he stated.\nSubairu added that delayed approvals further worsen the situation, as last-minute requests leave little\nroom for proper adjustments.\nHe said, “When they now request to get the suggested equipment from us, the time may have gone,\nleading us to concentrate on what we already have.”\nTo be continued"}

Carry trades -\nwhere fund purchases in higher-yielding currencies with currencies that are cheaper to borrow - are\nalready up 1.3% this year, according to a Bloomberg index tracking returns across eight emerging\nmarkets. With President Donald Trump's policies weighing heavy on the dollar, strategists at Morgan\nStanley, Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc. reckon last year's returns, the biggest since 2009,\nare about to extend. The index stands above 291 on Monday, about 5% shy of the record hit in 2011,\nwith currencies from the South African rand to Colombian peso hovering at multi-year highs. But aside\nfrom currency strength , carry strategies are also benefiting from high real interest rates in the\ndeveloping world. Policymakers in many developing countries are only gradually easing policy, despite\nsigns of slowing inflation. \"For carry trades, we are looking at countries where monetary policy is tight\nand central banks are considered credible,\" said James Lord, Morgan Stanley 's head of\nemerging-market strategy.Trades focused on Latin American currencies are among the top performers.\nThe Brazilian real, for instance, has already returned 4.5% so far in 2026, building on last year’s 23.5%.\nThe country’s interest rates are at 15% even though inflation has slowed toward the central bank’s\ntarget range. The Mexican peso’s carry trade has returned 4.3% this year, with Deutsche Bank\nmaintaining a bullish stance on the currency.Citi strategists too are among those recommending buying\nthe real against the dollar, though they also favor the Turkish lira.The Indian rupee, last year’s worst\nperformer, is extending those losses this year and is down about 2% in carry terms. The Indonesian\nrupiah has also put investors in the red.The record year for carry strategies was 2003 with a 25%\nreturn, the Bloomberg index shows. But to enjoy that kind of bumper year, investors will need the dollar\nto continue weakening, and emerging-currency swings to stay subdued. They will likely keep a close\neye on JPMorgan Chase & Co’s volatility gauge, which is at a three-week high after a prolonged spell\nof calm.BofA strategist Alex Cohen expects carry trades to continue outperforming, but only if volatility\nstays suppressed.“That’s a big ‘if’ as we sit here today” Cohen said, noting the possibility of geopolitical\nflare-ups."}

They say rigid rules and bureaucratic delays could undermine the\necosystem the scheme aims to strengthen.Industry executives broadly welcomed the intent to deepen\nstate support for chip design companies but flagged concerns around venture capital (VC)\ncompatibility, the structure of funding instruments, and the need for continuity for firms graduating from\nDLI 1.0.One startup founder said that while an equity-linked approach appears promising on paper, its\nsuccess will hinge on how friendly it is to global investors.Restrictions around intellectual property (IP)\nresidency and acquisition, the executive said, could significantly deter foreign VCs by complicating exit\npathways: an essential driver of venture returns.According to the founder, overly prescriptive IP rules\ncould push international capital toward more flexible jurisdictions such as Singapore and Delaware.The\nexecutive called for “light-touch regulation” that protects strategic interests without micromanaging\nownership or commercialisation rights. The person also stressed that startup founders and VCs should\nbe consulted during rule-making.Another startup executive drew a clear distinction between debt- and\nequity-linked support.Debt-linked funding for companies that have already reached commercialisation\nwas described as a “good idea” because it is non-dilutive, founder-friendly and often helps crowd in\nprivate capital.However, the executive questioned the rationale for government equity participation,\narguing that startups would typically prefer VC money over state equity due to concerns around\nbureaucratic oversight.Equity participation, the founder said, would only make sense if it came at a\npremium to private investors in the same round, while also questioning how such a mechanism would\ndiffer from the existing research, development, and innovation (RDI) fund.The executive also\nemphasised the need to retain a grant-based model for early-stage R&D-heavy; companies, similar to\nDLI 1.0, cautioning that removing grants could starve the pipeline of future chip designers.Another\nsemiconductor founder highlighted execution risks and cash-flow pressures faced by startups that have\nalready made technical progress under DLI 1.0.The executive urged the government to prioritise\ncontinued support for companies that have successfully built test chips and demonstrated readiness for\nproduction, or those that have raised significant additional capital since the first phase of the\nscheme.Lengthy detailed project report (DPR) requirements and extended evaluations, the founder\nsaid, are already creating delays.For startups preparing to move into production, these delays carry\nreal financial consequences, including substantial pending payments to IP vendors, fabs and advanced\npackaging partners.\"We have a burden of $6.4 million of fees we need to pay for IP vendors, fab and\npackaging partners, if we have to take this for production,\" he said.That said, in China, a huge\ngovernment-led investment vehicle was created in 2014. The China Integrated Circuit Industry\nInvestment Fund , commonly called the Big Fund, was established in September 2014 with\napproximately $200 billion in pledges from government and state investors; this fund is dedicated to\ninvesting in the semiconductor sector.Big Fund primarily operates by making equity investments in\ncompanies, one of the startup founders quoted above acknowledged. It is a state-guided investment\nfund that invests capital in semiconductor companies through equity stakes or similar investment\ninstruments rather than pure subsidies.Shares of the Big Fund are held by government entities such as\nthe ministry of finance and state financial institutions, such as China Development Bank, reflecting\nequity investment interests.Equity investment here means the fund takes ownership positions or capital\nstakes in companies. For example, in fabs, design firms and material/equipment suppliers, typically to\nfoster growth and build industry capacity.While DLI 2.0 could play a pivotal role in scaling domestic chip\ndesign, its structure must balance strategic oversight with commercial flexibility, the semiconductor\nstartup ecosystem said.Founders argue that continuity for proven players, non-dilutive support for\ncommercial-stage firms, grants for early R&D;, and VC-aligned rules will be critical if India is to remain\ncompetitive in the global semiconductor race."}

nothing changes for the tenant or the\nlandlord but just for new tenancies from 1 March.\n\"They have strengthened tenants' rights in that they will now have tenancies of minimum duration, so\nthey know that they have a certainty in terms of the length that they can rent for but it also brings in\nresetting of rents,\" he said.\nMr Browne said this will allow for greater investment and the delivery of homes.\nSinn Féin TD Eoin Ó Broin called the proposed legislation the \"Rip-Off Rent Hike Bill\".\n\"This is the most profound change to rent regulation in a decade, which will allow landlords to reset\nrents to market rates at the start of new tenancies and every six years after that,\" he said.\n\"From March 1st of this year, more and more renters will be subject to this new market rent reset rule,\nmeaning already unaffordable rents will be hiked up even further.\"\nOn the Cabinet agenda\nMeanwhile, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trade and Defence Helen McEntee was due to update the\nCabinet on the progress of legislation to abolish the Triple Lock.\nThe Government intends to end the requirement for a UN mandate when deploying members of the\nDefence Forces overseas.\nIt also plans to allow up to 50 troops to go on missions abroad without a Dáil resolution, but it is\nunderstood the Oireachtas Defence and National Security Committee would be informed.\nSpeaking as she arrived for the Cabinet meeting, the minister said plans to abolish the Triple Lock\nlegislation does not in anyway affect Ireland's neutrality.\nShe said it \"reinforces the proud tradition of our peacekeeping and it reinforces our ability of our troops\nto engage in peacekeeping missions on the ground which they have done for many decades\".\nCabinet permission will sought to allow the National Development Finance Agency to deliver projects\nMinister for Further and Higher Education James Lawless was due to bring a memo to the Cabinet to\nestablish the country's first National Skills Observatory.\nThe NSO will have a strong focus on AI to ensure workers and businesses are ready for the next wave\nof technological change.\nMinister for Health Jennifer Carroll MacNeill was due to update colleagues on the Waiting Time Action\nPlan, which sets out 36 measures to reduce the length of time patients are waiting to access care.\nThe Government is to use expertise from a State agency to help speed up infrastructural projects.\nThe first projects which will benefit from the move will be the redevelopment of the GPO on O'Connell\nStreet and the National Concert Hall in Earlsfort Terrace in Dublin.\nThe National Development Finance Agency is to support government departments in the delivery of\ncapital projects.\nThis follows a memo being brought to Cabinet by Minister for Public Expenditure Jack Chambers and\nMinister for Finance Simon Harris.\nNew ministerial guidelines will be issued to every department and departments will be asked to identify\nsuitable projects which could benefit from the new service.\nThe Cabinet was told this could shave months off the development cycles of major capital projects.\nThe new role for the National Development Finance Agency will reduce the need for external\nconsultants.\nThe agency will provide corporate governance arrangements for projects, preparation of businesses\ncases and support through the construction phase of projects."}

A new\nstudy from the University of Southern California (USC) says the satellite evidence is finally strong\nenough to measure.\nResearchers at the Keck School of Medicine of USC found that as more zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs)\nhit California roads, air pollution dropped in nearby neighborhoods. Using high-resolution satellite data,\nthe team linked EV adoption to the first statistically significant real-world drop in nitrogen dioxide (NO2),\na harmful traffic-related pollutant.\nThe headline number is modest but measurable: for every 200 ZEVs added in a neighborhood, NO2\nlevels fell by about 1.1% between 2019 and 2023.\nThe study, just published in The Lancet Planetary Health and partly funded by the National Institutes of\nHealth, adds rare real-world evidence to a claim that’s often taken for granted – that EVs don’t just cut\ncarbon over time, they also improve local air quality right now.\nWhy this matters\nEVs are usually framed as a long-term climate solution, but cleaner local air is where many of the\nimmediate public-health benefits should show up. NO2 is produced by burning fossil fuels and is linked\nto asthma attacks, bronchitis, and higher risks of heart disease and stroke.\nProving those benefits has been tricky. Ground-level air monitors are limited and unevenly distributed.\nA 2023 USC study suggested a connection between EV adoption and lower pollution, but the results\nweren’t definitive.\nThis study takes a different approach, using satellite measurements that can track NO2 across the\nentire state, daily.\n“This immediate impact on air pollution is really important because it also has an immediate impact on\nhealth,” said senior author Erika Garcia, PhD, MPH, assistant professor at USC’s Keck School of\nMedicine.\nHow the researchers tracked cleaner air\nThe team divided California into 1,692 neighborhood-sized areas, roughly comparable to ZIP codes.\nThey paired DMV data on ZEV registrations with readings from the European Space Agency’s\nTROPOMI satellite instrument, which detects NO2 by measuring how the gas absorbs and reflects\nsunlight.\nThe study included ZEVs such as battery-electric cars, plug-in hybrids, and fuel-cell vehicles.\nHeavy-duty trucks and semis were excluded.\nBetween 2019 and 2023, the typical neighborhood added about 272 ZEVs, with most adding between\n18 and 839. As ZEV numbers increased, NO2 levels consistently declined.\n“We’re not even fully there in terms of electrifying, but our research shows that California’s transition to\nelectric vehicles is already making measurable differences in the air we breathe,” said lead author\nSandrah Eckel, PhD, an associate professor at the Keck School of Medicine.\nPressure-testing the results\nThe researchers ran multiple checks to make sure the trend wasn’t driven by unrelated factors. They\naccounted for pandemic-era changes by excluding 2020 in some analyses and controlling for gas\nprices and work-from-home patterns.\nThey also saw the expected counterexample: neighborhoods that added more gas-powered vehicles\nexperienced increases in pollution. The findings were then replicated using updated ground-level air\nmonitoring data dating back to 2012.\nIn short, the signal held up.\nWhat comes next\nOver the study period, zero-emission vehicles grew from 2% to 5% of all light-duty vehicles in\nCalifornia, indicating significant potential to further improve air quality with ZEVs. Seeing how the\nCalifornia Energy Commission (CEC) reported last week that the state passed 2.5 million cumulative\nnew zero■emission vehicle (ZEV) sales in 2025, the state is very much on the right track.\nNext, the researchers plan to compare EV adoption with asthma-related emergency room visits and\nhospitalizations. If those trends line up, it could provide some of the clearest evidence yet of what we\nalready know: that electrifying transportation doesn’t just clean the air on paper; it improves public\nhealth in practice.\nIf you’re looking to replace your old HVAC equipment, it’s always a good idea to get quotes from a few\ninstallers.

According\nto its latest report, the IMF hinged growth across sub-Saharan Africa on Nigeria, as the sub-region is\nexpected to strengthen to 4.6 per cent in 2026 and 2027.\n“Growth is also expected to accelerate in sub-Saharan Africa, from 4.4 per cent in 2025 to 4.6 per cent\nin 2026 and 2027, supported by macroeconomic stabilisation and reform efforts in key economies,” the\nreport partly read.\nThe IMF’s 2026 revised growth projection for Nigeria of 4.4 per cent broadly aligns with Afrinvest’s\nestimate of 4.3 per cent as captured in its 2026 Macroeconomic Outlook Report.\nThe projections by Afrinvest were predicated on what it considered to be ongoing strategic\nprivate-sector investments in telecommunications (5G network investments by MTN Nigeria and Airtel\nAfrica), oil & gas (Dangote refinery expansion and Tony Elumelu’s acquisition of a majority stake in\nSEPLAT), agriculture (KONIG Agriculture Ltd’s $42.0m mid-term investment in Ondo State), and\nfinance & insurance (sector-wide recapitalisation) alongside carry-trade inflow prospects (with Nigeria’s\nelevated yields expected to attract high-yield-seeking foreign portfolio investors from Advanced\nEconomies), which will be pivotal to Nigeria’s economic narrative in 2026.\nEnterpriseNGR, a member-led professional policy and advocacy group, also projected a 4.49 per cent\ngrowth, which it said reflects a broad-based expansion across services, agriculture, trade, and\ntelecommunications.\nHighlighting the risks to the upward review, Afrinvest, in its weekly market research, said, “We are\nconcerned that poor management of global geopolitical alignments, heightened pre-election politicking,\nand stalled budgetary progress (with the proposed N58.2tn 2026 budget yet to be ratified and passed)\ncould materially undermine the growth outlook, given other subsisting structural constraints such as\ninsecurity and weak infrastructure.\n“The projected subdued global trade outlook for 2026 (with volume growth weakening to 2.6 per cent\nfrom 4.1 per cent in 2025) could further hurt Nigeria’s macroeconomic prospects, given that net receipts\nfrom crude oil, which account for about 85.0 per cent of total exports, are expected to contribute roughly\n35.6 per cent of the FG’s targeted N34.3tn in budgeted revenue.\n“Overall, we emphasise that effective fiscal management, de-escalation of the domestic political\nenvironment, and the rollout of people-centric policies with the potential to drive sustainable and\ninclusive growth will be paramount for Nigeria to navigate evolving global and domestic risks in the\nimmediate and near term.”\nThe PUNCH reports that President Bola Tinubu presented a 2026 Appropriation Bill of N58.18tn to the\nNational Assembly, and the budget has yet to be passed into law. Expected revenue stood at N34.33tn,\ncapital expenditure is estimated at N26.08tn, while recurrent non-debt expenditure stands at N15.25tn.\nDebt servicing is projected at N15.52tn, with a budget deficit of N23.85tn.\nEnterpriseNGR also holds a positive view of the oil & gas sector, saying, “The oil sector is also\nanticipated to make modest gains with improved security and operational stability. This assumes\ncontinuity of recent reforms in fiscal management, foreign exchange liberalisation, and infrastructure\ninvestment. Nigeria’s crude oil production is expected to average 1.5 million barrels per day in 2026.\nBrent crude prices are projected to remain in the $61 per barrel range, with Nigerian Bonny Light crude\ntypically trading at a slight premium due to its high quality. This balances production capacity, security\nconsiderations, and global market trends, while also factoring in the impact of domestic refining and\nplanned production expansion.\n“Nigeria’s oil sector is set for steadier performance in 2026, aided by domestic refining expansion and\nstable prices.”"}

The reliefs included declarations that:\nThe Claimants were not in breach of a settlement agreement dated 12 August 2016 (the “ Settlement\nAgreement ”) between PEL and the Claimants;\n”) between PEL and the Claimants; PEL is in breach of the Settlement Agreement;\nFHL continues to hold a 27.5% working interest in the Badin Assets; and\nPEL was not and is not entitled to seek forfeiture of FHL’s working interests in the Badin Assets.\nPEL filed an appeal in the UK Court to elements of the Award in January 2025, challenging the\narbitrator’s jurisdiction over certain of the reliefs. The final hearing of the appeal was held on December\n15, 2025. The UK Court’s dismissal in full of PEL’s appeal removes a material legal uncertainty\naffecting the implementation and legal enforcement of certain reliefs granted under the Award.\nIn addition to the appeal’s dismissal, the UK Court awarded approximately GBP 384,000 in costs to the\nClaimants and granted anti-suit injunction relief restraining PEL from continuation or commencement of\nany fresh proceedings in breach of the Settlement Agreement.\nFollowing the dismissal of PEL’s appeal, the Claimants have resumed all necessary steps to enforce\nthe Award.

The transaction is expected to close by the end of\n2026.\nThe Puma stake purchase builds on Anta’s growing portfolio of Western brands to capture rising\nChinese consumer demand for athleisure products post-Covid-19.\nThe stake purchase could pave the way for a full takeover of Puma, though Anta said on Jan 27 it\ncurrently does not have such a plan.\nThe Puma investment will accelerate Anta’s globalisation “and help drive the next chapter of growth for\nthe global sports markets including China,” said Anta chairman Ding Shizhong. “We believe Puma’s\nshare price over the past few months does not fully reflect the long-term potential of the brand.”\nChina’s biggest athletic apparel maker has been on a global brands-shopping spree and owns\ninternational sportswear labels including Fila, Descente and Jack Wolfskin. In 2019, an Anta-led\nconsortium paid US$5.2 billion for Amer Sports, owner of names such as Salomon and Arc’teryx.\nThe acquisitions have helped Anta capture China’s growing enthusiasm for outdoor sports to become\none of the country’s fastest-growing sportswear and equipment firms. A multi-brand strategy has\nhelped it post stronger sales than key mass market rivals – from international brands like Nike and\nadidas to local peers like Li Ning – despite consumer weakness and fierce price wars among retailers.\nStill, analysts cautioned that the Puma deal could further weigh on its namesake mass market label,\nwhich has revised down its 2025 revenue target.\n“The Anta brand was facing challenges stemming from strategy missteps. We argue that Anta’s\nmanagement resources may face additional dilution risks as a result of the Puma acquisition,” Jefferies\nanalysts said in a note, adding that Puma is a well-known label in China, making it difficult for Anta to\nachieve brand freshness.\nMeanwhile, Anta’s stock has lost about a quarter of its market value since August, in part because\ninvestors have factored in an acquisition of Puma, Citigroup analysts wrote in a note. However, they\nsaid Puma could see “significant upside” in its China business due to synergy in areas like branding,\nsupply chain and distribution.\nPuma has been working to reignite demand after struggling to generate momentum with consumers in\nrecent years, installing Mr Arthur Hoeld as chief executive and moving to refresh its leadership ranks.\nPuma closed on Monday at €21.63. Its shares have fallen more than 30 per cent over the past 12\nmonths. BLOOMBERG"}

This strategic move aims to ensure cleaner transport solutions\nand competitive advancements in the industry.\n\nNEW DELHI : India plans to map the carbon emissions of every vehicle segment over their life cycles to\nassess their impact on climate and help prepare a clear policy aimed at making the country a globally\ncompetitive clean-mobility hub by 2047, two people aware of the developments said.\nThe move is also expected to help settle future debates over automobile emission norms that have\ndivided the industry, they said.\nThe ministry of heavy industries, in consultation with industry and academia, is drawing up a new\nplaybook to track decarbonization levels from various powertrains in the world’s third-largest\nautomobile market, according to the draft Automotive Mission Plan (AMP) 2047, the two people said.\nMint reviewed the draft.\nThe life-cycle analysis (LCA) would include calculation of the emissions of a vehicle throughout the\nvalue chain, starting from the mining of critical minerals and metal ores used in the auto industry to the\nscrapping of vehicles and the recycling of electric vehicle batteries.\nAlso Read | Carmakers on edge over delays in notification of tougher emission norms\nEmission analyses are currently done on the basis of tailpipe emissions, or at best, well-to-wheel\n(WTW) assessments, which measure the energy consumption and greenhouse gas output of a fuel\nfrom its origin to its use by a vehicle.\nThese estimates miss large chunks of climate impact, especially of manufacturing and end-of-life\ndisposal, according to the draft AMP, which will set interim goals for 2030, 2037 and 2047. A clear\npolicy pathway for the auto sector in the form of AMP 2047 assumes importance as it contributes 7.1%\nof India’s total economic output and almost half of the country’s manufacturing output.\n“The life-cycle analysis of all vehicle segments could answer questions about carbon emissions made\nby different powertrains – ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles, hybrids, electric vehicles, and flex\nfuel vehicles. Currently, all the different methods of calculating emissions do not cover emissions from\nmining for lithium and other critical minerals, or even in the process of recycling these elements,\" the\nfirst person said, requesting anonymity.\nIndustry divided\nThis comes in the backdrop of the current fuel emissions controversy, wherein automakers are divided\nover benefits given to small cars under the soon-to-be-notified third iteration of the corporate average\nfuel efficiency norms (CAFE 3) norms, scheduled to come into force in April 2027. The industry and the\ngovernment were also yet to agree on whether to include the energy efficiency of EVs or count it as\nzero in the September 2025 CAFE 3 draft.\nElectric vehicles do not emit tailpipe emissions, giving them a distinct advantage if the tailpipe emission\nmethod is used for policy decisions. On the other hand, flex fuel engines use gasoline blended with\nethanol or other compounds and perform best in WTW comparisons, and EVs have an advantage only\nwhen they run on electricity from renewable sources instead of thermal power, according to the draft\nAMP.\n“LCA analysis would help in such situations,\" the first person said.\nThe AMP strategy is on framing a long-term pathway for green mobility and higher exports.\n“Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is crucial for shaping the development pathways of India’s automobile\nsector,\" according to the draft AMP. “It is also necessary to deploy policy measures, preferably\nincentives-based, to ensure that LCA outcomes (as well as polluting tailpipe emissions) are reflected\nadequately in the prices of vehicles.\"\nAccording to the draft, the pathway requires coordinated progress across electrification, hydrogen\nmobility, battery manufacturing, and circular value chains. A clear long-term roadmap can help align\npolicy, industry investment, and innovation priorities to position India as a globally competitive\nclean-mobility hub by 2047, it noted.\n\"Automobile design done on the basis of natural resource management and emissions has the potential\nto make this process more sustainable, compared to making designs only on the basis of comfort and\nconvenience,\" said Gurudas Nulkar, professor and director of the Centre for Sustainable Development\nat the Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics. “For this, an LCA is required—it is a scientific tool to\nreduce resource intensity.\"\nGoals and strategies\n“The AMP is supposed to be a comprehensive document on how the auto sector will behave. It takes\ninto account different strategies with every manufacturer having a different strategy and a different\nvision of the future,\" said the first person cited earlier. “Some believe that hybrids are intermediate\ntechnology and battery-operated electric vehicles (BEVs) are the end goal. Others may believe that\neven BEVs are the intermediary technology, and green hydrogen vehicles are truly the cleanest of all\npowertrains. The AMP looks to bring all these together.\"\nThe draft has pitched for tax incentives for the creation of auto sector intellectual property such as\npatents, trademarks, and designs, and takes domestic taxation policies into account. It calls for scaling\nup of EVs and localization of battery manufacturing by 2040, with near-complete electrification of twoand three-wheelers, and at least half of the cars, buses and trucks on Indian roads being EVs,\nhydrogen and flex fuels vehicles by 2047.\nThe playbook will involve short-term (till 2030), medium-term (till 2037), and long-term (till 2047)\nobjectives involving strategies on decarbonizing the sector, boosting exports and strengthening supply\nchains. The government has facilitated discussions among seven sub-committees and will now begin\nweighing in on the first draft in the coming weeks, according to the second person, who also spoke on\ncondition of anonymity.\nAlso Read | Govt links PLI incentives to testing, localization for electric quadricycles\nThe work on AMP 2047 started last year after China restricted exports of rare earth magnets – crucial\ncomponents in any vehicle’s transmission – putting global manufacturers, including Indian ones, into\nturmoil. Also, China’s 2023 new energy vehicle policy created tax incentives for EVs, hybrids,\nrange-extended hybrids and other vehicles, pushing consumers to opt for cleaner alternatives.\n“Countries that develop long-term policies provide clear direction to industry. For example, China’s new\nenergy vehicle policy has shaped the automobile strategy of the country’s manufacturers, first for the\ndomestic market and then for global markets\" said Amit Bhatt, India managing director at the\nInternational Council on Clean Transportation, an international think tank. “The NEV policy later\nintroduced electrification mandates and reduced incentives for bridge technologies such as\nconventional hybrids.\"\nEnergy security\nExperts said a long-term plan for the auto sector is essential for global competitiveness.\n“With tightening emission norms globally, Indian vehicles must meet green standards to remain\nexportable. A clear transition roadmap is also vital to attract significant capital inflows, as funds are\nincreasingly flowing into sustainable manufacturing and low-carbon technologies,\" said Poonam\nUpadhyay, director at Crisil Ratings. “Domestically, shifting to electrification and alternative fuels\nreduces reliance on imported crude, enhancing energy security and shielding the economy from oil\nprice fluctuations.\"\nQueries emailed to the spokespersons of the heavy industries ministry, the Society of Indian\nAutomobile Manufacturers, Maruti Suzuki, Tata Motors, Mahindra & Mahindra, Toyota Kirloskar Motor,\nBajaj Auto, TVS Motor, Ola Electric, Ather Energy, Hyundai, Kia, Ashok Leyland, JBM Auto, PMI\nElectro, and EKA Mobility on 23 January remained unanswered.\nShyamasis Das and Tarandeep Kaur wrote in a January 2026 report by the Centre for Social and\nEconomic Progress that given some of the challenges in the EV sector like supply-chain risks, there is\na case for diversifying India’s transport decarbonization strategy to consider other solutions such as\nbiofuels with a flex-fuel engine, and fuel cells.\n“However, these technologies have their own constraints. The absence of a clear direction in\ndecarbonizing road transport could lead to inadequate policy support, uncertainty in the industry and\nmarket inertia,\" they said.\nAMP 2047 will also help strategies to amalgamate Indian auto components makers into global value\nchains, according to the draft."}

I may just be a humble rock star. I'm also a knight of the realm, and I have my opinions,\"\nStewart said. \"I was born just after the war [World War II], and I have great respect for our armed forces\nthat fought and gave us our freedom. So it hurts me badly, deeply, when I read that the draft dodger\nTrump has criticized our troops in Afghanistan for not being on the front line.\n\"We lost over 400 of our guys,\" Stewart continued. \"Think of their parents. Think about it. And Trump\ncalls them almost like cowards. It's unbearable. So I'm calling on you, Prime Minister Starmer and\nFarage, please make the draft dodger Trump apologize. Please. Thank you.\"\nWhat Did Trump Say About NATO Troops?\nTrump once again invited controversy and made international headlines with his flippant remarks about\nNATO in a Thursday interview with Fox News in Davos, Switzerland.\n“I’ve always said, ‘Will they be there, if we ever needed them?’\" Trump said of NATO. \"And that’s really\nthe ultimate test. And I’m not sure of that. I know that we would have been there, or we would be there,\nbut will they be there?”\nThe president continued, discussing NATO's involvement in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks:\n“We’ve never needed them. We have never really asked anything of them. You know, they’ll say they\nsent some troops to Afghanistan, or this or that. And they did – they stayed a little back, a little off the\nfront lines.\"\nOf the roughly 3,500 allied troops who died in Afghanistan, the U.S. lost the most of any country with\n2,456 fallen soldiers. There were also 457 were British troops killed — the second-largest total per\ncountry and almost the same amount in terms of relative population, according to CNN.\nHow Did International Politicians React to Trump's NATO Comments?\nTrump's NATO comments drew swift condemnation from international politicians, including Prime\nMinister Starmer.\n\"I consider President Trump's remarks to be insulting and frankly appalling, and I'm not surprised\nthey've caused such hurt for the loved ones of those who were killed or injured,\" Starmer said on\nFriday.\nWhen asked if he would demand an apology from Trump, Starmer stopped just short of doing so,\nsaying: \"If I had misspoken in that way or said those words, I would certainly apologize.\" The famously\nunapologetic Trump seemingly walked back his NATO comments on Saturday with a complimentary\nTruth Social post.\n\"The GREAT and very BRAVE soldiers of the United Kingdom will always be with the United States of\nAmerica!\" he wrote. \"In Afghanistan, 457 died, many were badly injured, and they were among the\ngreatest of all warriors. It’s a bond too strong to ever be broken. The U.K. Military, with tremendous\nHeart and Soul, is second to none (except for the U.S.A.!).

The college is also\nparticipating in the International Education Fair (IEF) and hosting the School Leaders and Teachers\nConference (SLTC) 2026.\nThe governor noted that initiatives such as Westerfield College’s UK operations support Lagos State’s\nvision of empowering young people through globally competitive education, adding that such platforms\nhelp position Lagos as a hub of innovation and excellence. He commended the institution for creating\nopportunities that enable Nigerian youths to compete favourably on the global stage.\nWesterfield College, a leading Sixth Form institution with campuses in Nigeria and the United Kingdom,\nbecame the first wholly owned African school to offshore into the UK in 2025. The milestone was earlier\ncelebrated at its official launch held at the British High Commissioner’s residence, where Sanwo-Olu\npraised Dosunmu, an indigene of Lagos State, for the achievement.\nThe visit formed part of Westerfield College’s ongoing engagement with key education stakeholders as\nit continues to expand opportunities for Nigerian students and families seeking internationally\ncompetitive education pathways. During the courtesy call, the college reaffirmed its commitment to\nstrengthening educational linkages between Nigeria and the United Kingdom and supporting the\naspirations of young Nigerians through quality international programmes.\nIn his remarks, Sanwo-Olu highlighted the educational prowess of Nigerian youths, noting that their\ncontinued success across the world reflects the country’s strong human capital.\nHe said the establishment of Westerfield College in the UK opens new vistas for projecting Nigeria and\nLagos positively on the global education map.\nAs part of its current engagements, Westerfield College is hosting the School Leaders and Teachers\nConference (SLTC) 2026 and participating in the International Education Fair, a platform designed to\nprovide students, parents and schools with direct access to guidance on international education\nopportunities. A major highlight of these engagements is the Westerfield College UK Summer Camp\nProgramme.\nThe 2026 summer camp will run in three cohorts—from July 20 to August 1, August 3 to 15, and August\n17 to 29—at the college’s Worcester campus in the United Kingdom. The programme offers a holistic\nblend of academic tracks, including STEM, pre-medicine, business and law, computing and coding, as\nwell as arts and humanities.\nParticipants will also benefit from sports such as football, basketball, tennis and athletics, immersive\nEnglish learning, educational tours, leadership training and networking opportunities aimed at personal\ngrowth and global exposure.\nSpeaking during the visit, Dosunmu said Westerfield College is driven by a vision of education as a tool\nfor global mobility and personal transformation. He explained that the UK Summer Camp Programme is\ndesigned to help Nigerian students build confidence, global awareness and leadership skills, while\nproviding families with meaningful insight into the British education system.\nThe delegation also underscored the significance of Westerfield College UK, describing it as a major\nmilestone as the first African-owned and Africa-based school to establish a campus in the United\nKingdom. According to them, the UK campus blends British academic standards with Westerfield’s\npersonalised, student-centred approach, offering Cambridge A Levels, University Foundation\nProgrammes, pre-medicine courses and enrichment opportunities that support strong university\nprogression outcomes.\nThe courtesy visit, the delegation noted, reflects Westerfield College’s broader mission to collaborate\nwith government and education leaders in advancing access to high-quality, future-focused education\nfor Nigerian students, positioning the institution as a bridge between local excellence and global\nopportunity."}

MrBeast led the way with an assortment of hot drinks on offer, while a handful of other\nsponsored videos depicted boozier methods for keeping warm…\n\nWelcome to our rundown of the most-watched branded YouTube videos of the week.\nWe’re publishing this snippet of a larger Gospel Stats Weekly Brand Report in order to analyze\nsponsorship trends in the creator economy. Any video launched in tandem with an official brand partner\nis eligible for the ranking.\nAnd – as the name up above would imply – all the data comes from Gospel Stats. If you’re interested in\nlearning more about Gospel – and which brands are sponsoring what creators on YouTube – click here.\nYou can also download our YouTube 2025 Sponsorship Landscape Report here.\nTell us that title isn’t an anime you would watch. (And then Netflix would make a middling live action\nadaptation.)\nThis week, like last week, is largely Shorts. And, as usual, MrBeast is at the top. But we do have a\ncouple sponsors who aren’t normally in our top 5, including the very timely TurboTax. Don’t worry,\nthough–our bonus video will distract you from the impending doom of owing the IRS.\nCheck ’em all out right here:\n#1 30 Celebrities Fight For $1,000,000!\nChannel: MrBeast\nBrand: Jack Link’s\nViews: 95,013,830\nKevin Hart. Paris Hilton. Steve-O. Josh Peck.\nThat’s just a few of the 30 celebs MrBeast managed to trap in a circle for this ultra-glam version of his\ntried-and-true “do it longer than everyone else and I’ll give you some money” formula. For this\nvideo–sponsored by MrBeast’s ongoing partner Jack Link’s–celebrities didn’t compete for $1 million to\nkeep for themselves; they competed for $1 million to give the charity of their choice.\nThe rest of this video plays out pretty much like you’d expect. There are some challenges to push folks\nout of the running, some deep dives into why certain celebs are participating, and more…\nThe winning charity is obviously walking away peachy, but we think Jack Link’s is a pretty big winner\nhere too. In a deal with MrBeast, it got appearances by dozens of household names–and nearly 100\nmillion views to top it all off. Now that’s a snack.\n#2 What anime do you recommend to your friends? Watch the biggest anime catalog on @crunchyroll\nChannel: Mangaka Brandon Chen\nBrand: Crunchyroll\nViews: 12,810,418\nWe get to flex a little bit here, because we knew Brandon Chen before he landed his big Crunchyroll\npartnership. For those who don’t know him, Chen is an American manga writer who runs his own\nstudio, Inspired Productions, and is the creator of Just a Goblin on Webtoon.\nSafe to say he knows his stuff when it comes to manga and anime, which is why Crunchyroll tapped\nhim to make this Short where he recommends series for people who are brand-new to watching anime.\nIt’s a smooth move on Crunchyroll’s part: Chen’s picks are broad-interest shows that will appeal to a lot\nshow off his writerly prowess.\nAs for why this video got so many views, we’re guessing it has something to do with community\ninteractions. The video’s comment section is full of people recommending their own favorites, which\ncould also work in Crunchyroll’s favor. Chen’s video is just one part of a campaign that seems to be\npaying off for the streamer so far: Crunchyroll also sponsored the #6 most-watched video this week.\n#3 I love them they’re so random■ @turbotax #TurboTaxPartner #ad\nChannel: Carter Kench\nBrand: TurboTax\nViews: 11,093,113\nNobody likes taxes. It’s overly complicated, sometimes you owe money, and I don’t know if it’s just me,\nbut there’s always this perpetual sense of doom and constant worry that the IRS is going to come bang\ndown my door like Big Bird.\nBut Carter Kench says that’s not an issue for people who use TurboTax. His sponsor’s big feature for\nthe upcoming tax season? An auto-scan that looks at your W-2, then enters all the information in your\ntax return for you. Kench’s video hits hard on the DIY aspect of TurboTax: He filmed on the beach, in\nbed…All locations to give viewers the vibe that filing taxes will be easy-breezy.\nWe do think his creator viewers (and anyone who earns income outside a W-2) might find things more\ncomplicated, but TurboTax is going after the folks with regular jobs here. And it’s clearly resonated,\nsince this video has racked up over 11 million views. It’s also not the only video in TurboTax’s sweep\nthis week. The tax-filing software company sponsored nearly a dozen total, and we expect that number\nwill increase the closer we creep to April 15.\n#4 I Went To PROM In Heartopia!\nChannel: HyperCookiie\nBrand: Heartopia\nViews: 10,293,196\nThe newest cozy game entrant is here. We’re getting big Brookhaven vibes from Heartopia, which\nsponsored 10 videos this week where creators showed off its life sim environment where players\ninteract and come up with their own stories against the game’s cutesy backdrop.\nUnsurprisingly, HyperCookiie and many other creators Heartopia sponsored generally make content\nabout Roblox games (like Brookhaven, a similar life sim/RP environment). It’s clear the developers\nknow where to find their biggest potential pool of players–and that knowledge is working out.\nThis video got 10 million views, making it one of the highest-viewed #4 videos we’ve seen in a while.\nUsually by spot #3, we’re down from MrBeast’s gajillion views to a more normal ~5 million views or so.\nBut this week? We’re still above 10 million. Video views don’t drop down to ~5 million until spot #9, a\nKill Tony episode.\nBONUS #2721 FALLING into this books PLOT HOLES\nChannel: Reads with Rachel\nBrand: Ray-Ban Meta AI\nViews: 32,011\nI’ve been hearing a lot of talk about romance lately, mostly thanks to the exploding popularity of hockey\nromance Heated Rivalry. And while I will always be a staunch defender of romance as a genre,\nsometimes–like in all other genres–things just don’t go so well.\nThat’s Reads with Rachel‘s conclusion on Falling, a novel by best-friend writer duo Christina Lauren\nthat kicks off with a protagonist who goes to a Halloween party, dumps her boyfriend, and then hooks\nup with an angel. I haven’t read it, but Rachel’s main nitpick is how the plot sews together–or, well,\ndoesn’t.\nWhat’s clever about her sponsor for this video is that it’s FlexiSpot, a furniture ecommerce company\nwith a very broad customer base. But both FlexiSpot and Rachel made the marketing specific to her\naudience. If there’s one thing readers love, it’s cozy nooks. FlexiSpot has them nailed there. And then\nRachel links FlexiSpot to an emotional point for her, telling a story about going to visit her best friend,\nonly to be stuck with bad sleep because of a creaky bedframe. The solution is obviously new,\nsoundless bedframes from FlexiSpot.\nWe’ve said before how we dig brands that know how to source and connect with niche audiences,\nso…Nicely done, FlexiSpot.\n…and there’s a lot more data where that came from.

nothing changes for the tenant or the\nlandlord but just for new tenancies from 1 March.\n\"They have strengthened tenants' rights in that they will now have tenancies of minimum duration, so\nthey know that they have a certainty in terms of the length that they can rent for but it also brings in\nresetting of rents,\" he said.\nMr Browne said this will allow for greater investment and the delivery of homes.\nSinn Féin TD Eoin Ó Broin called the proposed legislation the \"Rip-Off Rent Hike Bill\".\n\"This is the most profound change to rent regulation in a decade, which will allow landlords to reset\nrents to market rates at the start of new tenancies and every six years after that,\" he said.\n\"From March 1st of this year, more and more renters will be subject to this new market rent reset rule,\nmeaning already unaffordable rents will be hiked up even further.\"\nOn the Cabinet agenda\nMeanwhile, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trade and Defence Helen McEntee was due to update the\nCabinet on the progress of legislation to abolish the Triple Lock.\nThe Government intends to end the requirement for a UN mandate when deploying members of the\nDefence Forces overseas.\nIt also plans to allow up to 50 troops to go on missions abroad without a Dáil resolution, but it is\nunderstood the Oireachtas Defence and National Security Committee would be informed.\nSpeaking as she arrived for the Cabinet meeting, the minister said plans to abolish the Triple Lock\nlegislation does not in anyway affect Ireland's neutrality.\nShe said it \"reinforces the proud tradition of our peacekeeping and it reinforces our ability of our troops\nto engage in peacekeeping missions on the ground which they have done for many decades\".\nCabinet permission will sought to allow the National Development Finance Agency to deliver projects\nMinister for Further and Higher Education James Lawless was due to bring a memo to the Cabinet to\nestablish the country's first National Skills Observatory.\nThe NSO will have a strong focus on AI to ensure workers and businesses are ready for the next wave\nof technological change.\nMinister for Health Jennifer Carroll MacNeill was due to update colleagues on the Waiting Time Action\nPlan, which sets out 36 measures to reduce the length of time patients are waiting to access care.\nThe Government is to use expertise from a State agency to help speed up infrastructural projects.\nThe first projects which will benefit from the move will be the redevelopment of the GPO on O'Connell\nStreet and the National Concert Hall in Earlsfort Terrace in Dublin.\nThe National Development Finance Agency is to support government departments in the delivery of\ncapital projects.\nThis follows a memo being brought to Cabinet by Minister for Public Expenditure Jack Chambers and\nMinister for Finance Simon Harris.\nNew ministerial guidelines will be issued to every department and departments will be asked to identify\nsuitable projects which could benefit from the new service.\nThe Cabinet was told this could shave months off the development cycles of major capital projects.\nThe new role for the National Development Finance Agency will reduce the need for external\nconsultants.\nThe agency will provide corporate governance arrangements for projects, preparation of businesses\ncases and support through the construction phase of projects."}

First: state terro…\n\nA long time ago I wrote a scholarly article about the use of state terror during the Argentine “Proceso”\n(https://www.jstor.org/stable/2111080).\nSeeing what is happening in the US, I thought I would reference a few things from that article. First:\nstate terror thrives in cultures of impunity. That is, where government authorities believe that they are\nimmune from prosecution for criminal acts that they order or undertake, especially when they occupy\nthe justice system and control the courts. The good news is that such a sense of impunity often leads\nthem to eventually over-reach and make mistakes that cause their downfall.\nSecond, as with all forms of terrorism state terror follows a target–subject–object logic. Individuals and\ngroups are targeted with state violence. The subject is the larger audience that witness state violence\neither directly or indirectly (via the media, word of mouth, etc.). The object is to intimidate the subject\naudience into submitting to the State’s authority, however illegally it is exercised.\nSpecifically, the object is to atomise and infantilize the body politic and society at large. “Atomization”\nmeans the forced breakup of collective identities and solidarity bonds, where people retreat into their\nown personal lives rather than risk being targeted by the State because of their collective ties to other\nsocial groups. They mind their own business, look away, do not make waves and certainly do not\npublicly confront the agents of repression even by peaceful non-violent means.\n“Infantilization” refers to the forced loss of personal agency, where people are psychologically reduced\nto the level of a child’s nightmare because of what they are living, where monsters are real and have\nimpunity when committing monstrous acts.\nIt may seem a stretch to say so right now, but the state violence being meted out by ICE and other US\nfederal agencies against both citizen and non-citizen members of the public seems to lie on a\ncontinuum that inevitably culminates in state terrorism. The MAGA administration’s double-down\nresponse to ICE killings suggests that is where they are prepared to go.\nThe only answer to this is mass collective resistance, using the legal avenues and social networks\navailable to people in spite of official judicial and extra-judicial retribution. There must be a groundswell\nof authentic grassroots push-back in spite of the inevitable dangers this poses to people’s lives and\nlivelihoods.\nI do not think that the US has reached the level of the state terror experiment of the “Proceso.” No yet.\nBut the mindset of those in power–the demonisation of opponents as “communists” and\nun-American/anti-American “wokesters,” the gaslight of the public by officials saying that what people\nhave seen with their own eyes is not true, that victims of state violence brought it on themselves and\nperpetrators of state violence are justified in their acts because it is making the country safe from\ncriminal “aliens” and their treasonous native-born supporters–is very much the same (and in the cases\nof Stephen Miller, Greg Bovino and Kristi Noem, might as well be right out of central casting for a movie\nabout the 3rd Reich). To reiterate, the US is on a continuum of violence when it comes to its\nincreasingly authoritarian trajectory, and state terrorism is the culmination of that continuum.\nI hope that my US whanau think about this as they go about their lives far from the front lines of\nMinneapolis, Chicago and other blue front-line states (because ICE is focusing its repression on\nDemocrat-supportive states and cities, not Red GOP-supportive electorates). Just because one is not\ntargeted now does not mean that one will never be.\nAnd as the saying goes, if you wait until they come for you, it will be too late."}

Stability is\nnon-negotiable,” he told an audience of global leaders.HE Alibrahim stressed the need for continual\ndialogue in reviving global growth: “No single convening, no matter how well intentioned, will resolve\nevery global challenge. But each time, there is an opportunity, an opportunity for us to be resolute and\ndeeply invested, and for us to build the culture that allows cooperation to function in the first place. A\nculture that nurtures strength and progress, and unlocks the potential of the global economy in all its\ndiversity.”Inviting delegates to attend the Global Collaboration and Growth Meeting: Building Common\nGround and Reviving Growth, HE Alibrahim said the meeting will build on the momentum of the WEF\nSpecial Meeting held in Riyadh, adding that Saudi Arabia has become “a global capital of pragmatism\nand of consequence”.HE added: “At a time when the global economy is confronting long-standing\nstructural challenges, this effort helps move cooperation from intent to outcome, by setting clear\nexpectations, anchoring responsibility, and ultimately, making dialogue count.”Commenting on the\nannouncement, Børge Brende, President of WEF, highlighted the Forum’s deepening engagement with\nthe Kingdom. He said: “We are pleased to return to Saudi Arabia in 2026 to carry forward the\nconversations started at our Annual Meeting – creating space for leaders to work together, build trust,\nand ensure dialogue leads to meaningful collaboration and action.”The Global Collaboration and\nGrowth Meeting reflects Saudi Arabia’s role as a reliable partner in fostering dialogue and supporting\ninternational stability to unlock prosperity.

For\nMichael Hill, three stores were closed (AU: 1, NZ: 2) and one new AU store was opened, taking the\nnetwork to 248 (AU: 123, NZ: 43, CA: 82).\nThe number of Bevilles stores operated by the company was steady at 37, meaning the total number of\nstores operated was 285, compared with 294 for the same period the previous year.\nMichael Hill Chief Executive Officer, Jonathan Waecker, said it was a good result.\nUnder new leadership, the group delivered profitable quarter-on-quarter growth, driven by significant\nperformance improvements in the final 10 weeks of the half, resulting in a materially improved trading\ntrajectory relative to the early FY26 trading update presented at the October AGM. A sharper focus on\nexecution, and the early impact of actions taken to stabilise and strengthen the business, delivered a\nmarkedly improved performance through the half. During the critical Christmas trading period, a strong\nfocus on driving customer demand, combined with more disciplined product planning, store operations,\nand targeted promotional activity, delivered profitable net sales growth while maintaining margin.

The\nCentre had expressed confidence of containing its fiscal deficit at 4.4% of GDP in FY26, having cut it\nsharply from 9.2% in the pandemic year of FY21, and beating its initial target of containing the financial\ngap at 4.5% by FY26. The Centre’s debt level is estimated to ease to 56.1% of GDP this fiscal, from\n58.8% in FY22. Zook expects the Centre to further adjust expenditure to continue narrowing fiscal\ndeficit. “Some of this adjustment is likely to come from the capex side,” he said.“We think public capex\nhas peaked and is likely to decline slightly from here,” said Zook of Fitch. Guzman at Moody’s\nhighlighted the recent trend of subdued nominal growth even as real economic expansion remains\nstrong. Achieving significant gains in lowering the debt ratio, pegged to the nominal GDP, will require\nfaster expansion, he reckoned.While the statistics ministry has estimated real growth this fiscal at 7.4%,\nthe nominal expansion is pegged at a five-year low of 8%, thanks to subdued price pressure in the\neconomy. Zook said if nominal growth does not return to above 10% in the coming years, reducing the\ngovernment’s debt-to-GDP ratio would become more difficult.S&P; last year raised its sovereign rating\non India for the first time in 18 years to ‘BBB’ from the lowest investment grade of ‘BBB-’, citing the\ncountry’s resilience and sustained fiscal consolidation. However, Moody’s and Fitch have retained their\nratings on the country at the lowest investment grade since 2020 and 2006, respectively. All three\nmaintained a ‘stable’ outlook.The executives expect India to remain the world’s fastest-growing major\neconomy at least this fiscal and the next. S&P;’s Phua forecast GDP growth at 6.5% and 6.7%,\nrespectively, in FY26 and FY27, “driven by strong consumption, despite the impact of US\ntariffs.”Guzman pegged the economic expansion rates for this fiscal and the next at 7.3% and 6.4%,\nrespectively while Zook projected 7.4% and 6.4%. Zook reckoned the government could unveil fresh\nreform measures in the Budget. “We anticipate that more concrete measures to advance deregulation\ncould be forthcoming,” he said. On US tariffs, Phua said a trade deal with Washington will reduce\nuncertainty and boost confidence, driving India’s labour-intensive sectors. Guzman expects the impact\nof the US tariffs to be tempered by notable exceptions for several of India’s key exports—particularly\npharmaceutical and electronic goods — and by New Delhi’s ongoing diversification and expansion of\ntrade relationships.According to Zook, the Indian economy has largely shrugged off the tariffs so far,\nbut over the medium term, “we see US tariffs as a potential headwind.” First, the tariffs give uncertainty\nto businesses and weigh on sentiments, which could constrain a pick-up in the private capex cycle, he\nsaid. Second, sustained tariffs at high levels, especially when regional peers have negotiated lower\nduties, limit India’s attractiveness as a foreign direct investment destination at a time when\nmultinationals are looking to diversify their supply chains, he said."}

We thank God that the casualties were not\nmany.”\nA statement by the governor’s spokesperson, Dauda Illiya, after the visit, disclosed that Zulum had\napproved the construction of new hospitals, water facilities, and others.\nTitled “Kirawa: Zulum approves hospital, water facilities, others,” Illiya described the approval as\n“immediate,” while stressing how the governor condemned the attack in the strongest terms.\nThe statement read in parts: “Borno State Governor, Professor Babagana Umara Zulum, has approved\nthe immediate construction of a new hospital, water facilities, and other essential infrastructure for the\npeople of Kirawa.”\nAccording to him, “Zulum announced the approval on Friday during an assessment visit to the\ncommunity, which was recently affected by a violent extremist attack.\n“The governor sympathised deeply with residents over the tragic incident and condemned the attack in\nthe strongest terms,” he stated.\nHe added that “Governor Zulum assured the people of his administration’s commitment to their safety\nand well-being.”\nHowever, four months gone, members of the community have expressed concerns about their daily\nstruggle to access water for drinking and other basic needs.\nThe anticipation for the fulfilment of the promise or expectations of equipment mobilisation to the\ncommunity for water dredging has remained a major topic for evening discussions among young adults\nand older residents.\nOur Correspondent’s investigations reveal that children between the ages of six and 18, and women\noften move in convoy around 5:30 am to form a queue, and in the evening around 4:30pm, using their\nlocally made wheelbarrows to source good and potable drinking water from a location known as Abuja\nCameroon, near the Cameroon-Nigerian border.\nThe tap water facility is situated towards the left-hand turn immediately after entering through the\nNigerian border side.\nOne of the women in the community, Hadiza Audu, recounts her daily ordain,”Sometimes, the people\nyell at us embarrassingly taunting us and our government.\n“The situation is likely to be more dire for school children as they prepare to resume school since the\nattack. Combining home chores, including dishwashing with going the distance to fetch water, may\nresult in lateness and affect their learning capabilities.\n“But some teachers are also not left out in the water crisis anyway. You won’t have to punish a child for\ncoming late after going through the stress of fetching water, when yourself as a teacher suffered the\nsame fate,” Mustapha Ahmed, a resident, said jokingly.\nHowever, another resident, Modu Aji disclosed that it is not the entire town that lacks access to water\nfacilities, but a significant population suffers water challenges, prompting the need to go the extra mile\nin search of the scarce resources.\nHe said, “Though not that the entire Kirawa do not have water, but it is not enough at all because for\nlocations like Thala Malama, it is even better for them to head towards Cameroon to get water than\nsourcing from any part of Nigeria because of their distance to areas where at least you can find water.”\nWhile efforts to speak with the Village Head of Thala Malama in Kirawa, Lawan Thagama Bukar, were\nunsuccessful, his Son, Isah Lawan, confirmed to Arewa PUNCH that getting water from the neighboring\ncountry has become a daily routine.\nHe narrated, “After Cameroonian security operatives left, and the Nigerian Security took over during the\npeak of the attack late last year, there has been relative peace. However, the promises the governor\nmade concerning the provision of water and the construction of hospital when he came to address us is\nyet to be fulfilled.\n“We don’t know what the plan is, but ever since the promise, we have not seen anything.\n“But to say the truth, to get water, we suffer a lot. We go as far as Cameroon to get water for our basic\nuse with a wheelbarrow. We do this every day,” Lawan stressed.\nThus, he also urged the government to look into its promise for the people whose houses and shops\nwere burnt down by the insurgents.\n“Let me add that our governor has promised that the people whose homes and shops were burnt down\nwould be supported; but they have yet to get the support.\n“I know that Governor Zulum is a person who, when he makes promises, he will definitely come and\nredeem them. Therefore, we are grateful to him for the peace and stability, and we hope that he won’t\nforget these promises,” he pleaded.\nAlso, speaking, the Bulama (ward Head) of Tashan Kirawa, Abubakar Alhaji, popularly known as\nBabikir, commended the governor for the deployment of security operatives to the area, saying the\naction has reinstated confidence in residents’ safety and security.\n“I thank the governor for resettling us and for his efforts in tackling the insecurity issue.\n“As of now, we are no longer scared of any insecurity-related issues. Everyone who was initially\ndisplaced after the attack has returned. The presence of the military and Civilian Joint Task Force has\ngiven us enough confidence,” he said.\nWhile recounting the promises made by the government, he lamp posted, “However, his excellency\nmade some promises to us. He mentioned road, water, and hospital. We had one health center before,\nbut during the attack, they burnt it down. So currently, our major worry is water and the hospital.”\nDanladi Modu, a class teacher at Kirawa UBE Junior Secondary School, also emphasised the\nchallenges faced by members of the community in accessing water while pleading for the state\ngovernment’s intervention.\n“The governor should come to our rescue on the water issue. The entire Kirawa is currently having\nwater challenges. We go as far as Cameroon to fetch water,” he stated\nA mother of two, Amina Hassan, noted that the promises were part of the anticipation that gave\nmembers of the community the confidence to return\nShe said, “The promises of hospital and water were the major things I heard that made me return after I\nescaped from the attack. Yes, the security promise has been fulfilled, but what is life when there is no\neasy access to water? For how long do we continue to cross the border over to the other side to get\nsome water?\n“Cameroonians are our good neighbours, but there is nothing like your own. It’s over three months now,\nat least, even if nothing is to be done with immediacy after our return. Water provision should be a\npriority. This is an appeal, and we beg the government at the local and state levels to come to our aid,”\nshe urged.\nEfforts to get comments from the General Manager Borno State Rural Water Supply and Sanitation\nAgency Dr Mohammed Musa were unsuccessful as he neither picked nor returned calls as of press\ntime.\nA text message sent to him was also not responded to.\nHowever, following the presentation of the 2026 budget by the state governor to the Borno State House\nof Assembly, residents expressed the hope that their community will be impacted\nArewa PUNCH, in December 29, reported that Governor Babagana Zulum presented a budget\nproposal of N890,331,686,000.00 for the 2026 fiscal year.\nTagged the ‘Budget of Sustained Recovery and Growth’, the governor highlighted that critical sectors\nincluding education, health, agriculture, and water resources will be impacted\nIn the budget, the Ministry of Reconstruction, Rehabilitation, and Resettlement got\nN58,710,006,000.00, Agriculture N44,947,429,000 and the Ministry of Water Resources\nN21,353,536,000.00 among others.\n“We hope our community will be among the beneficiaries of the 2026 budget for water provision,”\nopined Amina Hassan."}

Per section 138 of Companies Act, 2013 (the Act), all listed companies, irrespective of their\nsize and other companies meeting certain criteria are required to appoint an internal auditor.\nHowever, IA should be conducted by a chartered accountant or a cost accountant although the internal\nauditor need not be a firm of chartered accountants or cost accountants.\nWhile section 138 does not define what an IA is, Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 lays down that the\naudit committee or the board of directors shall in consultation with the internal auditor formulate its\nscope, functioning, periodicity and methodology. As good governance requires, management has no\nrole in this and quite rightly, the Act stays away from it rather than micromanage. This raises the issue\nthat since the statute has left the manner of designing the IA to the discretion of directors, how should\nthey address the issue.\nScope of IA\nLooking at some of the current practices, there is a need for companies to examine whether they are\ngetting the scope of IA right. Notwithstanding the absence of a statutory definition, there are some\npointers as to what could be the minimum acceptable level for section 138 as noted below:\nTo start with, to have an idea as to how onerous a director’s responsibility is, one should take a look at\nthe Directors’ Responsibility Statement referred to in section 134(3)(c) which is included in the report of\nthe board of directors to members of a company.\nSection 134(5) lists some specific matters for which directors accept responsibility. Considering that the\ndirectors of a company are giving a positive assurance with respect to these matters, it would serve the\nbest interests of the directors as well as the company to have them examined by internal auditors for a\npositive assurance.\nThe matters that would figure in the Directors Responsibility Statement are briefly: (i) preparation of\nfinancial statements that give a true and fair view and that the financial statements were prepared on a\n‘going concern’ basis; (ii) safeguarding the assets of the company, prevention and detection of fraud\nand other irregularities; (iii) in the case of listed companies, the company had laid down effective and\nadequate internal financial controls (IFC). Per section 143(3)(i), there is a corresponding responsibility\nplaced on the auditors to confirm whether the company has adequate IFCs with reference to financial\nstatements and whether such controls are operating effectively.\nSecondly. per section 177(4)(vii) The role of Audit Committee includes ‘evaluation of internal financial\ncontrols and risk management systems’; and per sub-section (5) ‘The Audit Committee may call for the\ncomments of the auditors about internal control systems, the scope of audit, including the observations\nof the auditors and review of financial statement before their submission to the Board and may also\ndiscuss any related issues with the internal auditors and auditors (appointed per section 139) and the\nmanagement of the company.\nSize of business\nThirdly, Companies Auditor Report Order, 2020 (CARO) requires the auditors to answer ‘whether the\ncompany has an internal audit system commensurate with the size and nature of its business; The\n‘Guidance Note on CARO 2020 (Revised 2022)’ issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of\nIndia (ICAI) states as follows (there is more, however, limited for brevity) ‘Generally internal audit\nfunction includes the following activities with regard to the entity:\n(i) Evaluation of internal controls.\n(ii) Examination of financial and operational information.\n(iii) Review of operating activities.\n(iv) Review of compliance with laws and regulations.\n(v) Evaluation of risk management and governance practices.\nFourthly, Standard on Audit (SA) 610 (Revised) ‘Using the Work of Internal Auditors’ defines Internal\nAudit as follows: ‘A function of an entity that performs assurance and consulting activities designed to\nevaluate and improve the effectiveness of the entity’s governance, risk management and internal\ncontrol processes’.\nLastly, Introducing the Standards of Internal Audit (SIA), the ‘Framework Governing Internal Audits’\nissued by the ICAI, Paragraph 3 defines internal audit as follows: ‘Internal audit provides independent\nassurance on the effectiveness of internal controls and risk management processes to enhance\ngovernance and achieve organisational objectives’. Although there is a slight difference between SA\n610 and the Framework of SIA, the central theme of IA is on the assurance of effectiveness of internal\ncontrols and risk management.\nAlthough the Act is silent about the scope of IA having left it to the discretion of audit committees and\nboard of directors, when it comes to reporting on the adequacy and effectiveness the auditors of the\ncompany have been bestowed a special status and have been charged with a responsibility by the\nCARO and SA 610 (Revised) dealt with above. There is a preponderance of intent even if not\nexpressed within the Act pointing out the direction of an IA.\nTherefore, before designing the IA, audit committees and the directors should take a close look at the\nmatters discussed above. This is the minimum expectation and in practice, several companies extend\nthe scope to other areas which are considered relevant and required as circumstances may warrant.\nThe National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA) has been giving guidance to auditors in the manner\nof dealing with the IA. A formal and structured IA built around the subjects mentioned above would give\na company a very effective IA ensuring that it fits into the corporate governance structure.\nAlso, compliance with Section 138 demands it. Going forward, as new thoughts are emerging in\ninformation dissemination to the stakeholders, and with non-financial information including\nsustainability and ESG demanding more attention, IA would need to keep up with the changing\nenvironment with a corresponding responsibility on the directors to be current.\nThe writer is a Chartered Accountant\nPublished on January 27, 2026"}

His comments, though, rattled\nthe industry, and over the next couple of weeks, steps were taken by studio and other industry reps to\nsteer the conversation toward an expanded set of federal incentives to boost film production. Among\nthose urging the president to support such an incentive is WME Group Executive Chairman Ari\nEmanuel, who called Trump as he was being interviewed by New York magazine.\nThe Post interview indicates that Trump has not given up on the idea of film tariffs, while he told the\nPost that he wanted to bring the movie business back to Los Angeles.\nTrump’s tariff authority is being challenged in court, with the Supreme Court expected to rule soon on\nwhether he had the power to impose the duties on an array of countries. Movies actually are listed as\nan exception to presidential authority under the International Emergency Powers Act, which gives the\npresident authority to address threats to national security and the economy. There also are questions of\nhow tariffs would apply to services.\nA spokesperson for the Motion Picture Association declined to comment.\nAmong studios, there also have been concerns that Trump would try to impose restrictions on any\nfilming overseas, as generous incentives in the UK, Canada and Australia long have lured Hollywood\nstudio tentpole production. Major Hollywood studios have come to depend on those overseas\nincentives as a way to try to reduce production costs.\nAccording to the MPA, the industry generated a positive balance of trade in every major market in the\nworld, with exports 3.1 times that of imports. The industry produced $22.6 billion in exports and $15.3\nbillion in trade surplus.\nThe California Post, an offshoot of the New York Post, launched on Monday."}

We have a passenger aircraft upside down,” about 45 seconds after a plane was\ncleared for takeoff. First responders arrived less than a minute later, airport director Jose Saavedra\nsaid.\nExperts say the weather and questions about whether ice accumulating on the wings kept the plane\nfrom getting airborne — as has happened at least twice before on that plane model — will likely be an\ninitial focus by the National Transportation Safety Board. However, the agency will consider all possible\nfactors.\n“You can count on the fact that NTSB is going to look very closely at this,” said John Cox, who is CEO\nof Safety Operating Systems.\nThe airport said Monday afternoon there were six people aboard, according to the flight manifest, and\nall died. Earlier in the day, the Federal Aviation Administration had said seven died and one was injured\nbut warned the numbers were subject to change, and the agency defers to local authorities.\nSnowfall was heavy elsewhere at the time of the crash, but accumulation had just started in Bangor.\nOther planes had been taking off safely. But about half an hour before the crash, the pilot of a\nFlorida-bound Allegiant plane radioed the tower to abort his takeoff.\nAP AUDIO: Investigators of fatal plane crash in Maine should examine its deicing process, expert says\nSound of an audio recording of air traffic controllers with someone saying “Aircraft upside down.

Follow on\n“One, our deice fluid has failed and two, I don’t think the visibility is good enough for us to go, so we’re\ngoing to have to taxi back to the gate here,” the Allegiant pilot radioed. The controller responded by\nsaying he was just getting ready to warn the pilot that visibility had dropped to about three-quarters of a\nmile.\nAt about the same time, the pilot of the Bombardier had taxied over to the deicing pad and was radioing\nin a request to get his plane’s wings and tail treated, according to audio posted by www.LiveATC.net.\nThe plane remained at the deicing pad for about 20 minutes before taxiing to the runway.\nHistory of icing problems with these planes\nThe Bombardier Challenger 600 model “has a history of problems with icing on takeoff” that caused\nprevious deadly crashes in Birmingham, England; and Montrose, Colorado, more than 20 years ago,\naviation safety consultant Jeff Guzzetti said. Even a little bit of ice on the wings can cause serious\nproblems, so careful inspections and de-icing are a crucial step before takeoff, the former federal crash\ninvestigator said. And there is a time limit on how long de-icing remains effective. It could last only\nabout 20 minutes.\nThe National Weather Service in Caribou, Maine, said the airport eventually received nearly 10 inches\nof snow, but it was just beginning to fall at the time of the crash. Wind speeds were about 10 mph,\nwhich is not out of the ordinary. Temperatures dropped below 3 degrees (minus 16 Celsius) while the\njet was in Bangor.\nCox said those conditions wouldn’t keep planes from flying.\nThe plane that crashed had just landed at Bangor from Houston at 6:09 p.m., according to\nFlightRadar24.com, so it would have likely been sitting outside in the snow for more than an hour\nbefore it tried to takeoff again. And it wouldn’t have taken long for ice to start building up on the wings\n— particularly if the plane was refueled with cold jet fuel that’s stored in wing tanks, a factor the NTSB\nhas cited in previous crashes.\n“Given the weather conditions at the time, and the history of wind contamination with this particular\naircraft, I’m sure that’s something the NTSB is going to look into immediately,” Guzzetti said. “If there\nwas any kind of precipitation at all, freezing precipitation, they would have needed to clean off those\nwings before they took off.”\nThe Bombardier Challenger 600 is a wide-bodied business jet configured for nine to 11 passengers. It\nwas launched in 1980 as the first private jet with a “walk-about cabin” and remains a popular charter\noption, according to aircharterservice.com.\nCrash investigators in England recommended improved procedures for ice detection after a 2002\ncrash, but significant changes weren’t made until after the NTSB finished its investigation in 2006 of the\nColorado crash that killed the son of NBC television executive Richard Ebersol.\nThe FAA published new rules afterward to make clear to pilots and airports that even a small amount of\nfrost on the wings can be a problem. The agency also clarified the standards for de-icing to make\ncertain that all frozen particles are removed from the wings, and it required a combination of tactile and\nvisual inspections.\nBombardier was also required to add a cold weather operations warning to the plane’s flight manual\nafter three incidents in Canada where one of these planes rolled unexpectedly in ways the pilot didn’t\ncommand during take offs in cold weather and icing conditions.\nThe planemaker said it has delivered more than 1,000 of Challenger 600s, and the plane is designed to\nbe safe. Bombardier said it is deeply saddened by the crash and will work with investigators to\ndetermine what happened.\nThe crash victims have not been officially identified\nThe identities of those onboard won’t be released publicly until they can be confirmed, officials said.\nThe jet was registered to a corporation that shares the same address in Houston as the personal injury\nlaw firm Arnold and Itkin Trial Lawyers, and one of the law firm’s founding partners is listed as the\nregistered agent for the company that owns the plane.\nThe international airport in Bangor, about 200 miles (320 kilometers) north of Boston, is one of the\nclosest in the U.S. to Europe and is often used to refuel private jets flying overseas. The Bombardier\nwas headed for France when it crashed.\nThe airport shut down after the crash and will remain closed at least until Wednesday so the FAA and\nNational Transportation Safety Board investigators can examine and remove the wreckage.\nA preliminary report outlining the facts of the crash should be released in about a month, but the final\nversion likely won’t be published for more than a year.\n___\nRamer contributed to this report from Concord, New Hampshire; and Funk contributed from Omaha,\nNebraska."}

The U.S. president\npreviously imposed the tariffs by declaring an economic emergency and bypassing Congress, while\nSouth Korea needed legislative approval for the framework announced in July and affirmed during\nTrump’s October visit to the country.\n“Our Trade Deals are very important to America. In each of these Deals, we have acted swiftly to\nreduce our TARIFFS in line with the Transaction agreed to,” Trump said. “We, of course, expect our\nTrading Partners to do the same.”\nThe threat was a reminder that the tariff drama unleashed last year by Trump is likely to be repeated\nagain and again this year. The global economy and U.S. voters might find the world’s trade structure\nconstantly being subject to disruption and new negotiations as Trump has already sought to levy tariffs\nin order to bend other nations to his will.\nTrump has in the past tied his tariffs to commitments by South Korea to invest $350 billion in the U.S.\neconomy over several years, including efforts to revitalize American shipyards. But the Trump\nadministration’s relations with South Korea have at times been rocky with the raid last year by\nimmigration officials at a Hyundai manufacturing site in Georgiathat caused 475 people to be detained.\nSouth Korea’s presidential office responded in a statement that the U.S. hasn’t officially informed it of\nthe tariff hike plan.\nIt said South Korean Industry Minister Kim Jung-Kwan, who is currently visiting Canada, will soon travel\nto the U.S. for talks with Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick.\nThe statement said Kim Yong-beom, the presidential chief of staff for policy, will convene a meeting to\ndiscuss Trump’s announcement.\nMonday’s announcement of new tariffs fits a pattern in which Trump plans to continue to deploy tariffs,\npossibly to the detriment of relations with other countries.\nJust last week, the president threatened tariffs on eight European nations unless the U.S. gained\ncontrol of Greenland, only to pull back on his ultimatum after meetings at the World Economic Forum in\nDavos, Switzerland. Trump on Saturday said he would put a 100% tax on goods from Canada if it\nfollowed through with plans to bolster trade with China.\nTrump has bragged about his trade frameworks as drawing in new investment to the U.S., yet many of\nhis heavily hyped deals have yet to be finalized. The European Parliament has yet to approve a trade\ndeal pushed by Trump that would put a 15% tax on the majority of goods exported by the EU’s 27\nmember states.\nThe United States is poised this year to renegotiate its amended 2020 trade pact with Canada and\nMexico. There are also ongoing Section 232 investigations under the 1962 Trade Expansion Act, as\nwell as an upcoming Supreme Court decision on whether Trump exceeded his authority by declaring\ntariffs under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act."}

nothing changes for the tenant or the\nlandlord but just for new tenancies from 1 March.\n\"They have strengthened tenants' rights in that they will now have tenancies of minimum duration, so\nthey know that they have a certainty in terms of the length that they can rent for but it also brings in\nresetting of rents,\" he said.\nMr Browne said this will allow for greater investment and the delivery of homes.\nSinn Féin TD Eoin Ó Broin called the proposed legislation the \"Rip-Off Rent Hike Bill\".\n\"This is the most profound change to rent regulation in a decade, which will allow landlords to reset\nrents to market rates at the start of new tenancies and every six years after that,\" he said.\n\"From March 1st of this year, more and more renters will be subject to this new market rent reset rule,\nmeaning already unaffordable rents will be hiked up even further.\"\nOn the Cabinet agenda\nMeanwhile, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trade and Defence Helen McEntee was due to update the\nCabinet on the progress of legislation to abolish the Triple Lock.\nThe Government intends to end the requirement for a UN mandate when deploying members of the\nDefence Forces overseas.\nIt also plans to allow up to 50 troops to go on missions abroad without a Dáil resolution, but it is\nunderstood the Oireachtas Defence and National Security Committee would be informed.\nSpeaking as she arrived for the Cabinet meeting, the minister said plans to abolish the Triple Lock\nlegislation does not in anyway affect Ireland's neutrality.\nShe said it \"reinforces the proud tradition of our peacekeeping and it reinforces our ability of our troops\nto engage in peacekeeping missions on the ground which they have done for many decades\".\nCabinet permission will sought to allow the National Development Finance Agency to deliver projects\nMinister for Further and Higher Education James Lawless was due to bring a memo to the Cabinet to\nestablish the country's first National Skills Observatory.\nThe NSO will have a strong focus on AI to ensure workers and businesses are ready for the next wave\nof technological change.\nMinister for Health Jennifer Carroll MacNeill was due to update colleagues on the Waiting Time Action\nPlan, which sets out 36 measures to reduce the length of time patients are waiting to access care.\nThe Government is to use expertise from a State agency to help speed up infrastructural projects.\nThe first projects which will benefit from the move will be the redevelopment of the GPO on O'Connell\nStreet and the National Concert Hall in Earlsfort Terrace in Dublin.\nThe National Development Finance Agency is to support government departments in the delivery of\ncapital projects.\nThis follows a memo being brought to Cabinet by Minister for Public Expenditure Jack Chambers and\nMinister for Finance Simon Harris.\nNew ministerial guidelines will be issued to every department and departments will be asked to identify\nsuitable projects which could benefit from the new service.\nThe Cabinet was told this could shave months off the development cycles of major capital projects.\nThe new role for the National Development Finance Agency will reduce the need for external\nconsultants.\nThe agency will provide corporate governance arrangements for projects, preparation of businesses\ncases and support through the construction phase of projects."}

Almost £11m was paid in the year to October 2025 to passengers whose\nclaims were rejected or left unresolved before being escalated to an independent adjudicator,\naccording to the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Customers told the BBC airlines had \"tried to confuse\"\nthem to make them drop claims. Airlines UK said: \"UK airlines take their consumer responsibilities\nseriously and always look to provide clear information and support for their customers in times of\ndisruption.\"\nThe association, which represents the airline industry, added: \"The latest Civil Aviation Authority\nConsumer Survey reflects this commitment, showing passenger satisfaction at their highest levels\nsince 2019.\" Graeme Bowd, who runs a consumer group on Facebook advising people on airline\nclaims, told the BBC: \"Weddings get missed, holidays get ruined and business meetings get cancelled\nand people find it extremely frustrating when they can't get their compensation claims settled.\"\nThe vast majority of the payouts detailed in the CAA's data came from British Airways (BA) followed by\nWizz Air, Ryanair and EasyJet. BA paid £6.9m to passengers whose claims the airline had initially\nrejected or not resolved. Of 10,679 complaints made against the airline, 81% were upheld in favour of\ncustomers after being escalated to an independent complaint body. BA said the \"vast majority\" of its\nflights run without issue. In the same 12-month period to last October, Wizz Air handed over £1.7m to\ncustomers, Ryanair paid £1.68m, and EasyJet shelled out £371,000 in passenger compensation. The\nCAA's data refers to complaints handled by the UK's two biggest adjudicators - the Consumer Dispute\nResolution Limited (CDRL) and the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR). A minority of\nissues are dealt with by smaller adjudicators.\nGetty Images\nEasyJet said: \"We always pay compensation if it is due and have an easy form customers can claim\nthrough on our website.\" Wizz Air declined to comment. Ryanair has been approached for a response.\nBowd said BA used \"several stock excuses\" such as \"adverse weather\" or \"air traffic control\nrestrictions\". But he said: \"When we check out these excuses we often find they're not valid at all, but\nit's very difficult for ordinary airline passengers to check for themselves. \"I think the general principle is\nthat they don't expect everybody to claim. For those that do, if they can be fobbed off and frustrated for\nlong enough, most of them will give up.\"\n'Bewildering information'\nLaurie Watson had been flying back to the UK from Athens after a sailing holiday when his return flight\nwas cancelled. When he tried to claim, BA told him there had been adverse weather conditions and\nrejected paying him compensation. But Laurie wasn't having it. After checking weather reports for the\nday he was due to fly, he disputed BA's rejection. \"They send such a bewildering amount of information\nthrough that a lay person couldn't understand it,\" he said. \"They're trying to confuse you, I think, and\nmake you drop the claim. \"It was lots of aviation speak and that made me more determined to follow it\nthrough.\" In a judgement seen by the BBC, CEDR found there was \"no persuasive evidence\" that\nLaurie's flight was affected by adverse weather, which would have resulted in such a delay, and the\nairline was ordered to pay him £700.\n'It didn't stack up'\nHeather Follows had been travelling to her cousin's wedding in Canada with her children but was told\nher flight with BA had been cancelled due to an engine issue. She was suspicious from the word go. \"It\ndidn't quite stack up at all,\" she said. \"I just felt like it was a tactical approach that they were using\nregularly to get away with rescheduling flights that weren't viable.\" Heather felt that BA was\nunconcerned with \"both the emotional hassle of trying to rearrange things and the personal\ninconvenience and the costs that I'd incurred and just the amount of time that was involved in actually\ntrying to get the paperwork together\". Adjudicators found that BA had not \"sufficiently demonstrated that\nthere were no reasonable measures it could have taken to avoid the cancellation of the flight\" and that\n\"the defect was known to the company at least since 2017\". In the end, BA was ordered to pay Heather\n£1,560. In response, BA said: \"Where customers submit claims for compensation that meet the\nlegislative requirements, our teams work very hard to process them as quickly as possible. \"In the\ncases raised, our teams have reached out to our customers to resolve the matters.\" It added: \"Most\ndelays and cancellations occur as a result of circumstances beyond our control, such as poor weather\nor air traffic control restrictions, but when issues occur, we always do our best to make things right.\"\nEasyJet said: \"If a flight is disrupted, we take our responsibilities seriously and always try to ensure\ncustomers are well informed and looked after.\""}

His message to citizens was clear:\nmedicines require proper guidance, and antibiotics, in particular, should always be consumed under\nmedical supervision. This public intervention reflects growing concern at the highest levels of\ngovernment about AMR and its far-reaching implications. According to data from the WHO, around\n1.27 million deaths are directly attributed to antimicrobial resistance (AMR) annually.\nThe economic cost of AMR is substantial and rising. Globally, AMR has already increased healthcare\nexpenditure by an estimated $66 billion. If resistance rates increase at the pace observed in the bottom\n15 per cent of countries, AMR-related health costs could escalate to $325 billion, while the global\neconomy could be $1.7 trillion smaller by 2050.\nConversely, providing high-quality treatment to everyone with bacterial infections and funding\ninnovation in new antibiotics could, by 2050, reduce health costs by $97 billion.\nAddressing AMR requires coordinated action across sectors. One such opportunity lies in creating\ncoalitions of willing countries to establish common funding pools for research and pooled procurement\nof innovative antibiotics.\nPublic awareness remains a critical pillar of the response to AMR. A national campaign — similar to\nthose undertaken for HIV, polio and tuberculosis — should be developed to educate patients and\nconsumers about the dangers of antibiotic misuse. Training programmes for doctors should be\nmandated by ICMR to raise awareness about AMR, including correct dosing, frequency and duration of\nantibiotic treatment.\nA dedicated platform that brings together central and State implementing agencies alongside industry\nstakeholders would enable structured discussions on the implementation of ICMR AMR guidelines. A\ndefined list of essential diagnostic tests should be formulated, and laboratory infrastructure must be\nestablished at the district level to support timely and accurate diagnosis. Finally, monitoring and\nauditing must become routine.\nThe Prime Minister’s call for responsible antibiotic use should serve as a catalyst for sustained action.\nMishra is former Health Secretary, and Bhattacharya is Secretary General, NATHEALTH\nPublished on January 27, 2026"}

His comments, though, rattled\nthe industry, and over the next couple of weeks, steps were taken by studio and other industry reps to\nsteer the conversation toward an expanded set of federal incentives to boost film production. Among\nthose urging the president to support such an incentive is WME Group Executive Chairman Ari\nEmanuel, who called Trump as he was being interviewed by New York magazine.\nThe Post interview indicates that Trump has not given up on the idea of film tariffs, while he told the\nPost that he wanted to bring the movie business back to Los Angeles.\nTrump’s tariff authority is being challenged in court, with the Supreme Court expected to rule soon on\nwhether he had the power to impose the duties on an array of countries. Movies actually are listed as\nan exception to presidential authority under the International Emergency Powers Act, which gives the\npresident authority to address threats to national security and the economy. There also are questions of\nhow tariffs would apply to services.\nA spokesperson for the Motion Picture Association declined to comment.\nAmong studios, there also have been concerns that Trump would try to impose restrictions on any\nfilming overseas, as generous incentives in the UK, Canada and Australia long have lured Hollywood\nstudio tentpole production. Major Hollywood studios have come to depend on those overseas\nincentives as a way to try to reduce production costs.\nAccording to the MPA, the industry generated a positive balance of trade in every major market in the\nworld, with exports 3.1 times that of imports. The industry produced $22.6 billion in exports and $15.3\nbillion in trade surplus.\nThe California Post, an offshoot of the New York Post, launched on Monday."}

We\nare working with our partners to continually review and improve the results.\nBrooks has a housing problem and says it has found a solution with a suite of incentives that caught the\nattention of out-of-town builders.\nMore than 200 new housing units will open this year in the city of 17,000 that is about 160 kilometres\nsoutheast of Calgary.\nThat’s a lot for a small market, but still only enough to absorb most of the residents considered to be\nliving in overcrowded situations, long-stay hotels or with multiple roommates.\n“It’s the biggest housing boom in 20 years,” said Lisa Tiffin, the manager of development in Brooks,\nwhich has a growing population, pent up demand and high rents.\nThose factors should have triggered construction activity years ago but, as an example to stress the\nseverity of the situation, only seven new residential units were added in 2022.\nHousing starts in Alberta's two largest cities last year way outnumbered those in all other municipalities.\n(CBC News Graphics)\nIn response, Brooks city council introduced a host of incentives: it scaled back taxes for four years, and\noffered zero-fee permits and a discount on city lots.\nThe next year, housing starts beat the three previous years combined, then tripled in 2025.\n“Over the past decade it was very patchy,” said Tiffin. “In 2024 we started to really see some\ndevelopers from bigger cities come and recognize the advantages of developing in Brooks.”\nWider boom missing small markets, says industry\nAlberta saw a record 55,000 home starts last year, according to Canada Mortgage and Housing\nCorporation, but fewer than one in 10 was built outside Calgary, Edmonton or their metropolitan areas.\nOne factor could be the localized capacity of the sector, said Scott Fash, the CEO of the Building\nIndustry and Land Development Association (BILD) of Alberta .\nA Calgary company with projects in Airdrie, for example, is common, but firms face challenges\nextending their work outside of larger or mid-sized cities.\nThere is demand, he said, but “there may not be a robust development community” in place.\n“These are communities that probably don’t have four or five active homebuilders,” he said.\n“It’s a provincewide issue that we’ve flagged. … How do you justify driving a crew two or three hours to\nbuild a house? How do you recover those costs?\"\nFash said municipal support is important and a way to overcome some financial hurdles, and while lot\nprices are much lower, smaller markets may not support the price of a newly built home.\nHe said another avenue may be better co-ordination between trade companies and developers to plan\nlarge projects, like an apartment block, or combining forces on multiple builds, like a row of townhomes.\nThat is the goal in the major rebuild of housing in Jasper after wildfires, said Fash, but could also be the\nmodel on a smaller scale in markets in southern and northern Alberta.\nAcute housing shortage in Brooks\nThe City of Brooks estimates its population has grown 10 per cent since the 2021 census.\nBrooks and County Immigration Services, which helps new arrivals and temporary foreign workers with\nimmediate housing needs, has seen wait times double in recent years.\nIn response, those in need of immediate accommodations often live with multiple roommates or take\nwhat is first available, often placing large families in small suites, said the organization's manager and\ncity councillor Mohammed Idriss.\nWATCH | Alberta sees major jump in housing starts: Alberta sees major increase in housing\nconstruction | Duration 1:25 Alberta says it has set an all-time record for the number of housing\ndevelopments started, and that the increased supply means people in the province are paying less rent.\n“It’s not very different from other communities big and small in Alberta and beyond,” said Idriss, citing\nchallenges in availability, suitability and affordability.\nRent in Brooks, for example, rose by 33 per cent over two years — one of the largest percentage\nincreases in Alberta outside of Calgary — before levelling off in 2025.\nAn average two-bedroom apartment now goes for $1,336 — about $350 more per month than three\nyears ago.\nBuilder sees opportunity to branch out\nThat market has caught the attention of large and small developers.\nRoyal Development began flipping houses and handling major renovations in the Calgary market, but\nowner Yassir Sabri was looking for start-to-finish homebuilding opportunities.\nHe considered Brooks because of the financial incentives, found local investors, and got to work.\n“Brooks has a unique business attitude,” he said. “You have land development availability, and the\npricing in Brooks, compared to Calgary, it made the numbers work and made it possible to build houses\nat a price point that fits the market.”\nSabri says he sees “real and steady” demand going forward.\nSpan West Building Corporation, of Saskatoon, has completed one condo project in Brooks, Alta., and\nis starting another. (Collin Gallant/CBC)\nThe company’s first duplex was completed this winter, and it has secured two more lots.\nBrooks also attracted Saskatoon-based Span West Building, which seeks projects in smaller\ncommunities across Western Canada for condo projects. It has sold out one 22-unit building on the\ncity's east side and is readying construction on a second.\nSubsidy shouldered by taxpayers, but worth it, say officials\nDevelopment associations and some politicians have long called for cheaper, easier and faster\npermitting time, along with residential tax breaks to speed up homebuilding and to ease affordability of\nhousing.\nThe Brooks tax program follows the phased-in approach recently allowed by the province. A qualifying\nnew home is fully exempt in year one, 75 per cent exempt in year two and so on, until it becomes fully\ntaxable in the fifth year after construction.\nThat leaves the existing tax base to cover costs, but it has keyed construction, which is a city priority,\nsaid Tiffin.\n“People have homes to live in,” she said. “Where we’re not collecting a municipal tax bill, we’re seeing\nnon-monetary benefits of having new housing in the community.”"}

Fanbases across the internet have called for the Jazz\nto be investigated or punished for their endeavors.\nFor anyone curious, the Jazz aren’t the only, nor the first, team to tank in the NBA.\ncan the NBA please investigate the Utah Jazz????? pic.twitter.com/FRFO20XBbF — tooforwon\n(@tooforwon241) January 11, 2026\nThe Philadelphia 76ers are one of the most famous organizations to champion the concept of tanking.\n“The Process” began in 2013, when the 76ers traded would-be star Jrue Holiday for Nerlens Noel to\nstart losing games.\nFor many years, the 76ers threw away seasons to draft quality players in hopes of ultimately winning a\nchampionship. To this day, The Process hasn’t truly ended – even though they drafted players like Joel\nEmbiid, they never made it to the championship. With teams like the 76ers and now the Jazz reportedly\nsitting players to improve their draft position, the league’s attention has been drawn to the longstanding\nissue.\nNumber 6■■ in our Top ■ \"WHAT IF\" moments in Philly sports history… What if the Sam Hinkie was\nable to finish \"The Process\"■ pic.twitter.com/R4AXgMEHcR — PHLY Sports (@PHLY_Sports) July 16,\n2025\nWhen Did Tanking Start?\nAccording to NBA reporters, tanking in the NBA truly started in the year 1984. At that time, the draft\nwould coin flip for the bottom two teams in the league to see who got the No. 1 pick. The rest of the\ndraft order would be decided by the bottom teams’ records. Each iteration of the draft the NBA put out\nstill faced the same issue: Teams figured out how to throw a season for a draft pick.\nThe most recent change in the draft odds happened in 2019 where the NBA flattened the odds for the\nbottom teams in the draft. The top three teams each have a 14% chance to win the first pick, and the\nodds get decreasingly lower from there.\nWhy Are the Jazz Tanking?\nIn 2021, the Jazz hired former Boston Celtics general manager Danny Ainge. Seeing the Jazz’s current\ncore fall in the first round to the Dallas Mavericks in 2022 was the final straw for Ainge and the rest of\nthe Jazz front office.\nLosing to the Mavericks was among the many playoff failures in the Donovan Mitchell and Rudy Gobert\nera. So, Ainge decided to make a big change for the team’s long-term success. Utah traded both key\npieces, Gobert and Mitchell, in 2022.\nGobert was sent to the Minnesota Timberwolves and Mitchell to the Cleveland Cavaliers\nAinge is known for making big trades and rebuilding teams quickly. He did this in Boston when he\ntraded Isaiah Thomas and drafted Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown. His rebuild led to a Celtics\nchampionship in 2024. Jazz owner Ryan Smith fully supported Ainge’s approach to rebuilding teams.\n“We’re not afraid to tear things down if they’re not working, and we’re always trying to climb,” said Smith\nin an early interview. “Is our goal to be really good or is our goal to win a championship? In Utah\nspecifically, we are trying to win a championship.”\nCan’t Be Ninth\nFor Jazz Nation, the rebuild has been a long, arduous process. Without being a major free agent\ndestination, is there any surprise they’d resort to the measure of tanking? The NBA has a problem in\nthat their culture is constantly bagging on smaller markets. Tanking offers another way teams can find\nblue-chip talent that wouldn’t come to them otherwise.\nWhat hasn’t helped this year is that the Jazz owe their protected lottery pick to the Thunder if it falls\noutside of the top-eight selections, since former Jazz general manager Justin Zanik traded Derrick\nFavors and the pick to OKC for a salary dump.\nThe Jazz hope their rebuild can mirror the Thunder’s. The Thunder made good trades and tanked so\nthey could gain talent like Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams. It led the Thunder to their first\nchampionship in 2025.\nMany could argue that it worked for the Jazz previously when they drafted the likes of Karl Malone and\nJohn Stockton. Even though it painfully didn’t lead to a championship, they acquired their talent via the\ndraft.\nUnintended Consequences\nTanking has become a heavily discussed topic in NBA meetings. Fans of the sport have been\ncomplaining for years now for the league to fix the issue. The Jazz unintentionally helped this narrative\nget pushed in said meetings.\nIn the 2022-23 season, the Jazz started with a 10-4 record in their first 14 games. Even though the front\noffice tried stripping the team down to the studs, players like Lauri Markkanen broke out, making the\nteam better. Halfway through the season, the Jazz traded away key veterans like Mike Conley to get\nworse, which they did. They tanked enough to keep their picks. The same thing happened in the\n2023-24 season as well.\nRecent Utah Jazz Regular Season Accolades 23-24 Keyonte George All-Rookie\n22-23 Walker Kessler All-Rookie\n22-23 Lauri Markkanen MIP\n22-23 Lauri Markkanen All-Star\n21-22 Donovan Mitchell All-Star\n21-22 Rudy Gobert All-Star What's the next award a Jazz player will win? pic.twitter.com/5zq4tmkq6n\n— Jazz Lead (@JazzLead) September 18, 2024\nThen the 2025 season rolled around, and the Jazz completely gave up. That year they sat so many\nplayers, like Markkanen, again. Eighth-overall pick Taylor Hendricks also broke his leg that year and\nrookie Cody Williams struggled heavily in the NBA.\nAll those factors aided the Jazz in having the worst record in the NBA the 2025 season, and what pick\ndid Utah land? All that losing gave the Jazz the fifth-overall pick while the Dallas Mavericks leaped\nfrogged everyone to get the first-overall pick.\nIn a way, the flattened lottery odds did their job at creating a more luck-driven draft. Though that hasn’t\nstopped teams like the Jazz or Washington Wizards from tanking this year.\nAny Bright Tanking Ideas?\nSo, the NBA has proposed a few ways to curb tanking: solidifying lottery positions on March 1 every\nseason, limiting pick protections, and disallowing teams from picking in the top four consecutive years.\nLimiting pick protections may cause teams to not want to engage in trade talks with the threat of losing\ndraft capital to others. Having the draft positions decided on March 1 is interesting. The only issue there\nis that teams may still sit players to help them stay healthy for next season.\nOf those suggestions, the one that could work is making sure teams don’t draft in the top four\nconsecutively for multiple years. Major League Baseball already has a rule in place like this to mitigate\nits own tanking. The rule can get complicated, but small market teams can pick in the lottery two years\nin a row while big markets can only do so once. After that, teams cannot pick in the lottery; they can\nonly pick at tenth or higher in the draft. Once that consecutive picking streak is broken, teams can once\nagain pick high in the lottery.\nThis could work in the NBA, but the league would have to be careful not to hurt small-market teams’\nchances at acquiring better talent. The years that they are incentivized to win could mean better Play-In\ntournament races. Instead of the same three teams constantly playing in the Play-In, the NBA might\nbuild diversity to help gain more interest in this preliminary round of the playoffs\nThe Mess You Made\nAs of right now, tanking is a necessary evil the NBA has to deal with in order to help bad teams become\ncompetitive again.\nWhile the Jazz haven’t necessarily flourished in the lottery, the draft has helped them gain talents like\nKeyonte George and Ace Bailey.\nThe NBA is now forced to either make a change to its culture or the draft. A consecutive-drafting law\ncould help their plight. Something else they can do is prop up and talk better about their smaller\nmarkets.\nIf the NBA could show off all of their markets, more players could be incentivized to go to different\nplaces besides New York or Los Angeles, hopefully helping other teams acquire better talent in the\nprocess."}

This can lead\nto chronic depression and anxiety.\n\nA person close to me, whom I’ll call Lila, invited me to attend a stage play. Lila’s dear friend, Carole,\nhad a lead role in the play and offered Lila two complimentary tickets. Many people love Lila for her\nenthusiasm, sense of humor, and warm way of making people feel truly seen and celebrated. Carole\nwas a successful character actress of film, stage, and television. Lila was excited to introduce me to\nCarole. We were both looking forward to the live theatrical production.\n\nCarole said she would leave the complimentary tickets at the box office window under Lila’s name.\nWhen Lila and I arrived at the theater, the box office clerk said there were no comp tickets reserved for\nus. I watched Lila’s face fall with embarrassment. I suggested we ask the box office clerk to send a\nmessage backstage to Carole, as I assumed it was likely an unintentional oversight. After all, opening\nnight for a new production can be hectic and demanding.\n“No,” Lila said. “I will buy our tickets.”\nLila bought two tickets, but I could see her mood shift from excitement to embarrassment and\nresignation. The performance was dazzling, and Carole disappeared into her character with perfection.\nAfter the matinee performance, I suggested we go backstage to tell her how much we enjoyed the\nshow and her performance. As we stood up after the show ended, Lila and I watched a famous actress\nwith her entourage walk backstage.\n“I bet she got our tickets,” Lila said.\n“I doubt that your friend intentionally gave your complimentary tickets away. We should go backstage\nand let her know how much we enjoyed the show,” I said.\n“No. Let’s just go,” Lila said. “It doesn’t matter.”\nEven though it was Carole who had made the mistake, Lila felt too embarrassed to mention it.\nOn the drive home, Lila said, “I don’t really matter much to Carole’s career. I’m a nobody.” She\nassumed that her lack of status in the show business community meant that her feelings and friendship\nwith Carole didn’t matter.\nLila felt unworthy of status and attention. Abandoned as a child, she felt shame whenever others\noverlooked or mistreated her. She couldn’t hold someone responsible for what they said they would do\nfor her, as she didn’t feel worthy of it in the first place.\nThe High Cost of Feeling Unworthy\nFeeling unworthy can impact every area of your life:\nHow you see your relationships\nHow you care for your health\nHow you look at possibilities in life\nWhat you expect of others\nWhat you will put up with at work\nThe salary you will accept\nYour level of resilience to stress\nWhen you don’t feel worthy or like you matter to others, you may react more strongly to social slights. It\nmight feel challenging to assert yourself or even feel entitled to moderate levels of respect or\nconsideration.\nThree Components to Mattering\nResearchers Rosenberg and McCullough (1981) identified three necessary components of mattering:\nFeeling like people depend on us\nBelieving that others regard us as important\nThe knowledge that other people actively pay attention to us\nThey determined, from their research, that the most crucial factor in feeling like we matter is attention.\nWhen the tickets were not at the box office, Lila felt unseen, irrelevant, and unimportant. It triggered the\nsame feeling of abandonment and unworthiness that she felt as a child.\nWhen we don’t feel like we matter much, it’s hard to regulate emotions under stress. It can lead to\nchronic depression and anxiety. When we feel like we matter to others, we’re more resilient, adaptable,\nand have better life satisfaction (Giangrasso et al. 2022).\nFeeling like you don’t matter is associated with higher levels of loneliness. Chronic loneliness can lead\nto negative health outcomes and leave us more vulnerable to stress (McComb et al. 2020).\nTo feel significant, some focus on attaining success and social status. Advanced college degrees,\npositions of responsibility, and parenthood can provide a feeling of relevance. Researchers found that\nnot only do we need to feel valued by others, but we also need to feel that we add value to others.\nBalance is best. We might assume that the famous actor gets enough attention from their fame and\nawards. Yet those who are famous also need to feel that they add value to others to benefit from the\nspotlight. Social status only gets us so far. We still need to feel that our efforts, our presence, and our\nlives add value to others (Prilleltensky, 2020).\nLila underestimated the value Carole placed on their friendship. She assumed that Carole would\nchoose to favor a famous acquaintance over a long friendship. Later, Lila spoke with Carole about the\nincident. Carole felt terribly embarrassed that she had forgotten to leave her comp tickets for us. She\nsaid that she wished we had come backstage and felt horrible about the oversight. No, she had not\ngiven the tickets to the famous actress as Lila had assumed. Carole promised to make it up to Lila on a\nsubsequent visit.\nIn a quote attributed to the writer Anais Nin, “We don’t see things as they are; we see them as we are.”\nWhen we feel we don’t matter, we might not notice how significant we truly are to the people in our\nlives, our communities, and our workplaces. It helps to challenge the belief that you are unworthy.\nStatus and worthiness are human constructs we make up anyway. Why not act as if you do matter?\nNotice the difference."}

The stock's decline\nreflects investor worries over the company sustaining its operating performance given escalating\ncompetition. This could force Eternal, which also runs quick commerce platform Blinkit, to ramp up\ndiscounts and promotion activities, affecting profitability.In addition, investors believe that\nslower-than-planned store expansion during the quarter might have triggered the better-than-expected\nprofitability due to reduced cash burn.With a greater need to accelerate quick commerce business\nexpansion in the face of competitive pressures , profitability in the coming quarters may suffer. While\nanalysts have retained a 'buy' rating on the stock, some have trimmed the 12-month target price by up\nto 14%.In the December quarter, Eternal's consolidated adjusted revenue and operating profit before\ndepreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) rose 19.5% and 62.5% sequentially to ■16,692 crore and ■364\ncrore, respectively. On a year-on-year basis, revenue nearly tripled while Ebitda grew 28%. Net profit\njumped 57% sequentially and 73% year-over-year to ■102 crore. The growth was largely driven by a\nmultifold jump in Blinkit's revenue to ■12,256 crore from ■1,399 crore a year ago.Blinkit added 211\nstores in the quarter, taking the total to 2,027, though it lagged the target of 2,100 stores due to\noperational constraints posed by the festive season and pollution-related curbs in Delhi NCR. The\nlower store rollout could have reduced cash burn, supporting sharp profit growth.Eternal has\nmaintained its target of 3,000 stores by March 2027, which may rise to 3,500-4,000 stores due to the\nintense competition. Given the slower rate of expansion last quarter, the company will have to increase\nthe pace of opening new stores in the current quarter to achieve the net order value (NoV) growth of\n100% year-on-year.This may, in turn, increase the cash burn, affecting profitability in the March\nquarter.The food delivery business under Zomato brand continued its steady recovery, with adjusted\nEbitda margin edging up to 5.4%. While the 'going-out' segment's losses widened during the quarter\ndue to continued investments, it is expected to reduce sequentially hereon and break even in the next\n4-6 quarters. Eternal's business-to-business grocery supply arm Hyperpure's revenue grew 4.6%\nsequentially to ■1,070 crore. Eternal aims to achieve $1 billion in revenue and 4-5% adjusted Ebitda\nmargin in the next three years.Emkay Global Financial Services and Motilal Oswal Financial Services\nreduced their target prices by around 14% to ■370 and ■360, respectively, though keeping 'Buy' rating\non the stock. On January 23, the stock was trading at ■258.7 apiece on the BSE. The markets were\nclosed on Monday due to Republic Day.Emkay noted in a report that while Eternal put in a strong\nprofitability surprise at Blinkit, the sector remains in a land-grab phase, which may compel the company\nto trade margins for market share.According to Motilal Oswal, while Blinkit's breakeven is encouraging,\nthe respite is short-lived as peers have aggressive discounting and promotional spending. It expects\nheightened competitive intensity to delay Blinkit's profitability trajectory and has trimmed adjusted\nEbitda estimates by 15% for FY28."}

While some Republicans and independent voters\nare skeptical, many supporters believe Trump is reviving American…\n\nLive Events\nas a Reliable and Trusted News Source Addas a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\nMOSCOW, Idaho: When President Donald Trump bombed Iran last summer, Nathaniel Cheevers, 24,\nthought: \"Yup, that's exactly why I hired you.\"When Trump has veered from the way diplomacy is\ntypically conducted, Cheevers saw him as doing \"the most American thing a president can do.\"As for\ntaking over Greenland, \"the idea that we shouldn't expand our borders is kind of ridiculous,\" he said.\n\"That's how we made the country.\"Trump's foreign policy whirlwind of recent months has bewildered\nmany, including Republicans who wish he were spending more time fixing problems closer to home.\nHis grab for Greenland and his attacks on Venezuela, Nigeria, Iran and beyond have confounded those\nwho thought \"America First\" would mean fewer foreign interventions.But for now, Trump's supporters\nappear largely to be giving him the benefit of the doubt when it comes to foreign policy. Where critics\nsee bluster, they see the \"art of the deal.\" Where even some Republicans see an abandonment of the\npostwar rules and alliances that made America prosperous, Trump's fans laud a president reviving the\nspirit of Theodore Roosevelt. And while Trump may appear to be contradicting his campaign rhetoric\nopposing military adventures, the president's mantra of \"peace through strength\" still resonates.Overall,\nTrump's foreign policy may yet prove a political liability, and polls show that independent voters are\ndeeply skeptical of it. For now, Trump's military moves have been quick and have not cost American\nlives, meaning that public opinion could sour further if a future intervention is more painful. And Trump's\nlatest foreign policy decisions are being made against the background of growing anger over his\nadministration's actions in Minnesota, a furor that could drown out any successes he tries to point to\nabroad.Still, the blowback from his base about his overseas interventions has been limited. Trump\nappeared to back down from his demand for taking over Greenland last week, but the framework of a\ndeal he says he reached with NATO over the Danish-owned island remained unclear.\"Trump's base\nhas a phobia or a distaste or an objection to endless wars,\" said Douglas Wilson, an evangelical pastor\nin Moscow, Idaho, who has emerged as one of the president's most prominent defenders on the\nultraconservative Christian right. \"But they don't have an objection to flexing militarily.\"Polls show\nconcern about the economy and a widespread view that Trump is not focusing on the right priorities.\nBut they also show Republicans to be largely on board with his aggressive foreign policy.A Marist poll\nconducted Jan. 12 and 13 found that most Republicans favored the United States' taking military action\nin Venezuela, Iran, Mexico, Cuba and even, at 57%, Greenland. A Quinnipiac poll conducted Jan. 8 to\n12 showed only 23% of Republicans supporting the use of force to take Greenland, but 67% supporting\nattempts to buy it.In Washington, even conservatives who favor restraint in foreign policy have found\nthings to like in Trump's global hyperactivity of the last few weeks.Curt Mills, executive director of The\nAmerican Conservative, a magazine founded by the 1990s right-wing presidential candidate Patrick\nBuchanan, called Trump's attack on Venezuela \"foolhardy.\" Attacking Iran to support protesters, he\nsaid in an interview, would seem jarring when the administration is \"currently trying to suppress protest\nin Minnesota.\"But finding a peaceful way to annex Greenland, he said, \"is the most sympathetic thing\nthe government has proposed doing on foreign policy in nearly a century.\"\"The European argument that\nthis could unravel NATO -- what a bonus,\" Mills said.Interviews in Moscow, Idaho, last week showed\nthat Trump's supporters were inclined to trust the president's foreign policy, even if they sometimes\nstruggled to explain it. Brandon Mitchell, the area's representative in the Idaho House of\nRepresentatives, endorsed Trump's interest in Greenland, even though \"I kind of don't know where he's\nat on that and why.\"\"There's a lot of things that he does that I kind of questioned and then I'm like, 'But\nthat worked,'\" said Mitchell, a Republican who operates Jiffy Lube shops.In downtown Moscow -- the\nsecond syllable is \"coe,\" not \"cow\" -- America's divisions are palpable on every corner. Gay pride flags\nare displayed at businesses aligned with the liberal community revolving around the main campus of\nthe University of Idaho in town. And then there are the buildings associated with Wilson, one of\nAmerica's best-known Christian nationalists; Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is part of his\ndenomination.Watched closely by security guards, Nick Solheim, a rising political operative who had\nflown in from Washington, gave a speech at Wilson's New Saint Andrews College urging the students\nto join him in the fight against their \"enemies.\" He highlighted Trump's campaign message about \"an\nend to endless wars,\" and attacked \"Republican elites\" such as Sen. Lindsey Graham of South\nCarolina for teaming up with \"establishment hawks.\"Solheim, 28, said nothing about Trump's own\nmilitary interventions, instead praising his trade deals and mass deportations. In addition to cofounding\na group, American Moment, that aims to train the next generation of Republican aides, Solheim has\nmused about buying Greenland since at least 2021.In an interview, he described Trump's pursuit of\nGreenland as having \"spiritual\" significance, because \"our nation has stagnated in a certain sense.\"\"We\nhaven't been to the moon since, what, the '70s or '80s,\" he said. \"We haven't explored new territory. We\nhaven't conquered anything.\"One of the young men in Solheim's audience was Jacob Gartrell, 19,\npresident of the University of Idaho chapter of Turning Point USA, the right-wing group founded by\nCharlie Kirk. Gartrell said he appreciated Trump's attacks on \"drug boats\" near Venezuela because\neach bombing was saving hundreds of lives, echoing the president's contention about the strikes. (He\nsaid he was speaking only for himself, not his group.) But he had issues with other aspects of Trump's\nforeign policy, because he believed that the United States already had too many foreigners.\"If we were\nto take over both Venezuela and Greenland,\" he said, their residents could \"just hop on a plane and\ncome to America.\"Trump has not talked about annexing Venezuela, but has promised to \"run\" the\ncountry indefinitely. Still, Gartrell's concern highlighted the contradictory impulses of Trump supporters\nwho want their leaders to turn inward but also to project strength.Florian Justwan, a political science\nprofessor at the University of Idaho, said there were early indications in his own, unpublished survey\nresearch of the seeming foreign-policy contradictions in Trump's base: core supporters of Trump\nappear both more likely than other Republicans to say that the United States should concentrate more\non its own problems, and more likely to favor military action in places like Greenland and Latin\nAmerica.Justwan said that Trump's populist approach to foreign policy -- including sharing private texts\nfrom world leaders -- still appeared to resonate with his base.\"It's about anti-elitism,\" he said. \"It's about\ndoing what's right for the in-group.\"Indeed, after the campus Turning Point USA meeting on Friday\nnight, Ben Coons, 22, said it was \"really cool\" that Trump was making \"people respect us when we feed\nthem and take care of them.\" He said that last summer he'd visited Denmark, where they \"pooh-pooh\nAmerica all day long.\"But there was also some unease. Wilson, the far-right Christian leader, said that\nacquiring Greenland was a \"good, noble goal,\" as long as it was done \"peaceably.\" Striking Venezuela\nwas \"defensible\" because \"what you had was a drug cartel that had seized control of a government.\"\nBut airstrikes for changing the government in Iran would not be, because \"what's the American foreign\npolicy interest in doing this with naked military power?\"The success of the Venezuela mission, he\nwarned, \"invites a spirit of hubris.\"\"Thus far, Trump is living a charmed life in foreign policy,\" Wilson\nsaid. \"So take risks when you need to, but don't resort to it first thing.\"Wilson has said that his flock\nmakes up some 10% percent of Moscow's increasingly polarized population of around 25,000 people.\nAt the town's Unitarian Universalist church, the Rev. Elizabeth Stevens said she believed there was no\nlonger a single Trump supporter in her congregation.Stevens said parents of adolescents had told her\nthey worried \"that we are going to slide into World War III and their kids are going to get called up and\nput at risk.\" She pointed to Trump's renaming the Defense Department the Department of War and the\nadministration's turn against U.S. allies, international law and the United Nations.\"A lot of people are\nmaking comparisons to heading into World War II, and this time we're on the wrong side,\" Stevens said.\n\"There's a lot of fear.\""}

The ambition is to reverse the decline in Ministry of Defence (MOD) spend on SMEs, as\nidentified in the Defence Industrial Strategy.\nThis will also help deliver on the Government’s pledge to increase defence spending with SMEs by\n50% by 2028 and is a significant vote of confidence in around 12,000 SMEs across the UK, marking an\nimportant step in removing barriers faced by SMEs at a crucial time for national security and innovation.\nThe team will help to simplify and speed up cumbersome processes, provide advice to SMEs, and\nencourage private sector investment, supporting the Defence Secretary John Healey’s pledge to make\nBritain the best place in the world to start and grow a defence business.\nThe OfSBG will oversee a comprehensive programme of change, ranging from policy and commercial\nprocess simplification – such as improving cash flow when under contract - to encouraging private\ninvestment by providing long-term clarity on procurements. This work is in addition to enhancing\ntransparency and knowledge sharing within the sector, all aimed at backing British SMEs.\nAs well as visiting the National Manufacturing Institute Scotland, which backs the manufacturing of\ninnovative technology, Minister Pollard also visited SMEs on Monday, including Viper::Blast, based in\nAberdour, who specialise in fast, high-fidelity simulation of air blast, explosive detonations, and\nstructural loading.\nMinister for Defence Readiness and Industry, Luke Pollard MP, said:\nSmall businesses told us defence procurement was too slow, too complex and too hard to navigate. We\nlistened, and now we’re acting. We’re breaking down barriers and opening new avenues for innovation.\nWe are ensuring that our SMEs can play a vital role in strengthening our defence capabilities. Defence\nis an engine for growth, and small businesses are the backbone of UK defence. This is a collective\nendeavour, and we are committed to supporting British businesses, enhancing our security, and driving\nprosperity for working people across the country.\nScottish Secretary Douglas Alexander said:\nThe creation of the Defence Office for Small Business Growth is great news for Scottish businesses,\nworkers and the economy as it will help boost opportunities and access to investment, supported by our\npledge to increase spending with SMEs by £2.5 billion by May 2028. Defence is already a key driver for\nrenewal in Scotland, with the Ministry of Defence spending more than £2 billion a year with the sector in\nScotland, supporting nearly 12,000 industry jobs. Now with our historic uplift in spending to protect our\nown and European security and this new support for small and medium enterprises we will further\ntransform the sector. As we up our game on defence, Scotland’s world class industry and supply chain\nand global demand for Scottish expertise will play a big role in ensuring Britain’s security, deterring our\nadversaries and driving economic growth for years to come.\nUK SMEs saw £1.2 billion of direct investment from the MOD in 2024/25. To make defence even more\nof an engine for growth, the Government has set an SME spend target of an additional £2.5 billion\nthrough to May 2028, taking total MOD spending with SMEs to £7.5 billion.\nFor both new and existing suppliers, the OfSBG will act as a central hub for advice and support on\nengaging with defence, ensuring procurement processes are faster, simpler and more effective.\nServices include structured guidance on tendering, contracting and working with the MOD and wider\ndefence supply chain, mentoring schemes, networking opportunities with prime contractors,\nsignposting to regional defence clusters and trade associations, and a confidential channel for SMEs to\nraise concerns.\nA public-facing web portal and contact centre will initially support 30 SMEs, from carefully selected\nsectors, covering cyber to aeronautical engineering, and covering the whole of the UK from the south\ncoast of England to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. They represent a cross section of industry\nincluding those who have previously worked with the MOD and those who are new, ensuring industry is\nsupplying the best of British capabilities to defence. These companies will help rapidly test, trial, and\nrefine the service before planned expansion to embrace the wider business community over the coming\nweeks and months.\nNational Armaments Director, Rupert Pearce, said:\nSMEs are the backbone of UK defence, bringing the innovation, agility and fresh thinking that our\nArmed Forces need to stay ahead of evolving threats. A more vibrant SME supply chain means better\ncapability for our Armed Forces, greater resilience in our industrial base, and economic growth for\ncommunities across the country. I look forward to working with businesses of all sizes to deliver on this\nambition. By working across defence, government and with private investors, we will build a dynamic\necosystem of innovative, well-capitalised small businesses ready to deliver the capabilities our Armed\nForces need.\nThe work of the OfSBG will be reinforced by the newly introduced SME Commercial Pathway, providing\nclear, accessible guidance to ensure MOD teams are actively reducing barriers and increasing\nopportunities for SMEs to bid for and win MOD work.\nThe Pathway covers improved market engagement, reserving below-threshold procurements for SMEs,\nsegmenting contracts to enable greater participation, engaging with prime contractors to manage SMEs\nwithin their supply chains, and strengthening SME resilience through improved cash flow when under\ncontract.\nThe OfSBG will collaborate across defence, government departments, strategic partners and private\ninvestors to create a dynamic UK ecosystem of well-capitalised, high-growth small businesses.\nThese businesses will be encouraged to enter the defence market and contribute to rapidly delivering\nwarfighting readiness to the UK Armed Forces - a key pillar of the Strategic Defence Review.\nThis government is delivering the largest sustained increase in Defence spending since the end of the\nCold War – hitting 2.6% of GDP from 2027. That will see £270 billion invested into defence across this\nParliament. Increased investment in Small and Medium enterprises will ensure defence is an engine for\ngrowth in all the regions of the UK."}

The stock's decline\nreflects investor worries over the company sustaining its operating performance given escalating\ncompetition. This could force Eternal, which also runs quick commerce platform Blinkit, to ramp up\ndiscounts and promotion activities, affecting profitability.In addition, investors believe that\nslower-than-planned store expansion during the quarter might have triggered the better-than-expected\nprofitability due to reduced cash burn.With a greater need to accelerate quick commerce business\nexpansion in the face of competitive pressures , profitability in the coming quarters may suffer. While\nanalysts have retained a 'buy' rating on the stock, some have trimmed the 12-month target price by up\nto 14%.In the December quarter, Eternal's consolidated adjusted revenue and operating profit before\ndepreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) rose 19.5% and 62.5% sequentially to ■16,692 crore and ■364\ncrore, respectively. On a year-on-year basis, revenue nearly tripled while Ebitda grew 28%. Net profit\njumped 57% sequentially and 73% year-over-year to ■102 crore. The growth was largely driven by a\nmultifold jump in Blinkit's revenue to ■12,256 crore from ■1,399 crore a year ago.Blinkit added 211\nstores in the quarter, taking the total to 2,027, though it lagged the target of 2,100 stores due to\noperational constraints posed by the festive season and pollution-related curbs in Delhi NCR. The\nlower store rollout could have reduced cash burn, supporting sharp profit growth.Eternal has\nmaintained its target of 3,000 stores by March 2027, which may rise to 3,500-4,000 stores due to the\nintense competition. Given the slower rate of expansion last quarter, the company will have to increase\nthe pace of opening new stores in the current quarter to achieve the net order value (NoV) growth of\n100% year-on-year.This may, in turn, increase the cash burn, affecting profitability in the March\nquarter.The food delivery business under Zomato brand continued its steady recovery, with adjusted\nEbitda margin edging up to 5.4%. While the 'going-out' segment's losses widened during the quarter\ndue to continued investments, it is expected to reduce sequentially hereon and break even in the next\n4-6 quarters. Eternal's business-to-business grocery supply arm Hyperpure's revenue grew 4.6%\nsequentially to ■1,070 crore. Eternal aims to achieve $1 billion in revenue and 4-5% adjusted Ebitda\nmargin in the next three years.Emkay Global Financial Services and Motilal Oswal Financial Services\nreduced their target prices by around 14% to ■370 and ■360, respectively, though keeping 'Buy' rating\non the stock. On January 23, the stock was trading at ■258.7 apiece on the BSE. The markets were\nclosed on Monday due to Republic Day.Emkay noted in a report that while Eternal put in a strong\nprofitability surprise at Blinkit, the sector remains in a land-grab phase, which may compel the company\nto trade margins for market share.According to Motilal Oswal, while Blinkit's breakeven is encouraging,\nthe respite is short-lived as peers have aggressive discounting and promotional spending. It expects\nheightened competitive intensity to delay Blinkit's profitability trajectory and has trimmed adjusted\nEbitda estimates by 15% for FY28."}

Today’s KevinMD article is “wRVU threshold risks in\nphysician contracts.” Dennis, welcome back to the show.\nDennis Hursh: Thanks, Kevin. It is great to be here.\nKevin Pho: All right, so tell us what your latest article is about.\nDennis Hursh: I have run into more and more contracts now where the employer gives the physician a\nsalary, but it is dependent on a certain number of work relative value units (wRVUs), and a lot of issues\ncome up with that. I mentioned in my article that one of the first issues is that the salary doesn’t mean\nanything. I am seeing some contracts now that say they pay you a specific salary assuming you are\ngoing to work a certain number of wRVUs. If you do not work the wRVUs, there is nothing in the\nagreement that says they will take back money. So first you have to see if it is just a meaningless\nclause. What I think they do sometimes is set it up and then at renewal say that the assumption was\nyou would do this many wRVUs, and you didn’t, so now they are going to reduce your salary. In effect,\nyou have to look at the effect of that provision.\nThe biggest thing you have to look at is whether it is a reasonable threshold. If you have been there for\na few years, we know what your wRVU production is. There is no reason why if you have been\nproducing 6,000 wRVUs a year that we would come in with a contract that says your minimum is 8,000.\nThere is no reason to believe that you are going to hit that this year if you haven’t in previous years.\nObviously, you can look at benchmarks, but your own history is probably an even better guide. There\nare a few things to be aware of there.\nIf you are just starting your practice, you should not be expected to be super productive. If they just\nhired a new physician, that physician is going to take some time to ramp up. A practice should have a\nguaranteed salary for at least a year, and a lot of times for two or three years. Another thing I see that\nmakes me nuts is where they give you a median salary for your specialty in a location, and it is\ndependent upon you doing the 60th percentile of productivity. There is a mismatch there. If they want to\npay you at the 60th percentile, it is reasonable to expect 60th percentile productivity. But I see these\nmismatches all the time where the salary is low and the threshold is high. There is a gray area where\nyou are working harder than what you are being paid for, but you are not being compensated.\nAnother issue that is very important is that you ought to be able to confirm your numbers. I had a\nspecialist physician working really hard seeing patients with a full schedule. They came in and were\ngoing to fire him. It was not a reduction in salary; they were going to fire him because he was so\nunproductive, and his contract did not give him the right to audit. We finally talked to the administrator,\nand they were showing him as having two patients a day. I do not know if they were mixing up provider\nnumbers or what they were doing, but this was a fully engaged, very busy physician. The numbers they\nwere showing showed him seeing about two or three patients a day. It is important that you be able to\nconfirm it.\nThe last thing you have to worry about is when it is credited. It makes sense that if you see a patient\ntoday, you will be credited for the wRVU today. A lot of contracts do not use the date of service. They\nuse the date of billing. I have had instances where a hospital billing staff got short-staffed. You cannot\nblame them if you are the CEO. You want your billing staff sending out the bills for the $900,000 ICU\nvisit, not the physician office visit. It is a reasonable business decision to put off billing. However, I have\nhad physicians lose bonuses because something screwed up. They were busy, but their wRVUs were\nnot billed. As far as their contracts said, they were not being productive.\nKevin Pho: Before asking some questions, for those who are not familiar with the intricacies of\nphysician contracts, just give us a 30-second primer of what a wRVU is and how that factors into most\nphysician contracts.\nDennis Hursh: To say most might be a stretch, but it is important. A wRVU is a work relative value unit.\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the government looking at how to pay physicians, has\ndone a lot of studies. The concept of a wRVU is that it represents the work you have done. It is a little\nbiased because they prefer procedures over thinking. You tend to get more wRVUs for a procedure\nthan even a very difficult patient that you are trying to piece through what is going on. In general, the\nconcept is that a wRVU represents a certain amount of work. A complex cardiothoracic surgery is a lot\nof wRVUs, whereas a level one office visit is going to be significantly less. That is the concept that\nshows how much work you are doing or how productive you are being.\nIn a hospital situation, it is not a bad way to do things. If you did collections, you would be penalized if\nyou were seeing Medicaid patients or the uninsured. This means at least you are getting paid the same\namount for a private pay patient, a patient with really good insurance, or a charity case. You are still\ndoing the work. In that sense, it is not a horrible thing that you are paid on wRVUs. You just have to\nwatch out for these issues.\nKevin Pho: Approximately what percentage of physician contracts are based or influenced in part by\nwRVUs?\nDennis Hursh: I can’t say exactly, but from what I have seen, I would say probably 80 to 90 percent. A\nlot of them will have salaries and then give you a productivity bonus if you exceed a certain number of\nwRVUs. They give you so much per wRVU, and some are really “eat what you treat.” A lot of times after\nyou have been there a few years, you are on “eat what you treat.” They pay you a draw and call it a\nsalary. They are going to pay you a certain amount, but they are going to true it up at the end of each\nquarter and at the end of each year. If it turns out you were not that productive, they are going to want\nsome money back.\nKevin Pho: When you first introduce that concept of wRVUs, there are a variety of red flags and things\nto be careful of that physicians should be aware of. In general, when it comes to these wRVU targets,\nwhere do administrators and hospital systems get these numbers from in terms of the target percentile\nvalue?\nDennis Hursh: There are benchmarks. The ones I like are from the Medical Group Management\nAssociation, but there are others out there, and some of them amalgamate several benchmarks.\nSometimes it seems like they just get a consultant in that says if you can get this many wRVUs out of\nthe doctor, we are going to make a lot of money. Some of them do not seem to have any relationship to\nbenchmarks at all, but in theory, they are based on some kind of benchmarking.\nKevin Pho: In terms of the percentile that physicians should aim for, whether it is the 50th percentile or\n75th percentile, how do they come up with those numbers? Are they just purely consultant-based? Are\nthey just pulling these numbers up from thin air?\nDennis Hursh: I think they are one I see a lot, which is the 60th percentile. They expect you to be at the\n60th percentile of productivity. I wouldn’t have as much of a concern with that if you were being paid at\nthe 60th percentile. It seems fair that you would be producing at the 60th percentile. My concern is\nwhen they are paying you less than that, but they expect you to be producing at the 60th percentile.\nKevin Pho: Let’s go through a couple of scenarios and just tell us your advice if a physician finds\nthemselves in that particular scenario. Let’s say the target wRVU is the 60th percentile. If a physician is\nproducing under that for that year, tell us the type of risks that they may encounter if they are producing\nunder the target wRVU value.\nDennis Hursh: In a lot of cases, they will figure it out. Let’s say we are paying you $100,000 and we\nexpect 100 wRVUs at $1,000 per wRVU. These numbers are crazy, but say it is $1,000 a wRVU. If you\ncome in at 98 wRVUs, a lot of times they will say that they were paying you $1,000 per wRVU, and you\nwere two short. You owe them $2,000 in that scenario. They will say this is your salary divided by this\nnumber of wRVUs, and that is what they are going to charge you if you do not hit it.\nKevin Pho: If a physician exceeds that target, would they get some sort of bonus based on how much\nthey exceed that target by?\nDennis Hursh: They should get the same. Another thing I see is that a lot of times they will penalize you\nmore for the wRVUs you do not make than you would think. If you are getting $100 a wRVU, if you go\nover the thresholds, you should get $100. A lot of times if you miss it, the penalty is $100, but they will\ngive you $50 for every wRVU over the threshold. There should be a match there. If you are penalized,\nyou should get the same amount if you go over.\nKevin Pho: You also mentioned the mismatch. If a physician produces above the target wRVU but is\nstill getting paid below their production, how does that gray area or mismatch sometimes get resolved?\nDennis Hursh: Usually it does not. That is the kind of thing you have to negotiate in your contract. If you\nsay that you will accept a certain salary, and that salary is the median, and you accept a certain\nthreshold, and that is the 60th percentile, that is where it is. If you come in at the 55th percentile of\nproductivity or 59th percentile of productivity, you get your salary and that is it. A lot of it is just in your\ncontract. What you are being paid should match up to the percentile productivity you are expected to\nproduce.\nKevin Pho: From the spectrum of contracts that you see, you mentioned some red flags that need to be\nnegotiated specific to wRVUs when a physician first works for an employer. Review for us the top three\nconcerns a physician should think about at the negotiating table when it relates to wRVUs.\nDennis Hursh: I think the first thing is whether it is a reasonable threshold. If you are paying me at the\n50th percentile, then the threshold should not be at the 60th. I always think the date of service is very\nimportant. You should also be able to confirm the numbers. I think those are probably the three biggest\nthings that you need to focus in on.\nKevin Pho: From your experience with physician contracts, how much wiggle room is there for those\nspecific things that you talked about? Are they mostly included, or is it something that employers push\nback on? Tell us the type of reactions that you get.\nDennis Hursh: The one that I get the most pushback on is the mismatch between salary and\nproductivity. A lot of times they say that their compensation committee has said this is what the other\nphysicians are making and they think the 60th percentile is right. That is the one I get the biggest\npushback on. Sometimes they will say that administratively they just cannot do that. Administratively,\nthey know a wRVU when it hits the billing system, so they cannot do it. I am not going to argue about\nthat. Confirmation usually is not a big deal. If you think about it, if you are an employer and you are\npaying me on productivity, if you are smart, you are going to be keeping me apprised and saying where\nI am. You might say that I am behind and maybe I should schedule more patients or do something. The\nconfirmation usually is not such a big issue, but salary versus threshold is probably the biggest one that\nI see and sometimes the hardest to negotiate.\nKevin Pho: When it comes to these wRVU compensation systems, of course, it has to be accurate in\nterms of the measurement of the wRVU. Should a physician independently keep track of their own\nwRVUs, or is it OK to rely on what the hospital comes up with?\nDennis Hursh: I think it pays to keep track of your own. I do not think it needs to be tracking that you\nsaw Susie Smith and did this wRVU. I think just keeping your schedule and looking at it helps. If\nsuddenly your production has dropped and you do not feel like you have been a lot less busy, it is nice\nto have something to go back on. Even keeping your schedule a lot of times will remind you that Susie\nSmith had a complex procedure. You can check to see if that is reflected or if a big procedure was\nbilled. I think it does help to keep track. I hear there are some folks out there that are now developing\nsoftware to catch your own wRVUs. I have not spoken to anybody that is using it, but it seems like if it\nwould be easy to do, it would be a nice thing to keep track of.\nKevin Pho: Let’s talk about another scenario, and that is the new physician. A lot of times new\nphysicians get guaranteed salaries for the first one to two years, and then they switch over to a\nproductivity-based wRVU system. In that situation, what should physicians look out for, especially new\nphysicians coming out of residency who may not be familiar with any of this? What are some of the red\nflags they should look out for whenever they are looking at their first contract with a guaranteed salary\nfor the first couple of years?\nDennis Hursh: The first thing is you should still be eligible for productivity. The fact that you may not hit\nit and you are going to get your salary anyway means you should still be eligible for a productivity\nbonus. It is the same thing. The productivity threshold should be pretty close to your compensation\nthreshold. That is one thing to look at. If you are getting a productivity bonus, you want to be able to\nconfirm it, along with all the things we have talked about. The other thing you want to check is to make\nsure that it really is a guarantee. I have seen some contracts that had a guaranteed salary, but the\nemployer kept track of the wRVUs. At the end, your salary was guaranteed, but you have a deficit on\nthe wRVUs, and that rolls into the next quarter. So you are starting your first quarter on productivity in\nthe hole. It is important that if it is guaranteed, it means any deficit is erased when the guarantee period\nends. I have seen people really nailed by that one.\nKevin Pho: Let’s zoom out a little bit. I think that with a lot of productivity-based contracts, I have heard\nthat some may be transitioning to more quality metrics influencing compensation, or value-based\nmetrics influencing compensation. What are you seeing in terms of that hybrid where productivity may\nbe becoming less important and more of these quality metrics and value-based metrics are coming in\nand influencing compensation instead?\nDennis Hursh: I am seeing it, but I see too many that say you have 10 percent or even 20 percent\npotential quality compensation dependent on you hitting the wRVU targets. Some of them are written\nwhere they want you to hit 5,000 wRVUs. If you hit 4,999 wRVUs, then the quality bonus is off the table.\nIf you think about that, it is maddening. Quality is quality. If you are doing good quality, you should get\nthat bonus. It should not be contingent on maintaining a certain productivity. That is the biggest trap you\nhave to watch out for. I am seeing more and more quality compensation coming in.\nKevin Pho: It sounds like as of today, a lot of hospital systems still value productivity above all else.\nDennis Hursh: They do. There is money involved. The reason they are doing quality, let us not kid\nourselves, is because the payers are incentivizing them on quality. I would love to say the hospital\nadministrators just spend all their time worried about patient care, but I do not think that is true. They\nare compensated based on quality, but the bottom line more times than not is going to be based on\nphysician productivity. They are still very focused on that.\nKevin Pho: Today, we are speaking at the beginning of the new year. As it relates to physician\ncontracts and especially productivity-based metrics like we are talking about today, what kind of trends\ndo you see in 2026 coming up when it comes to these physician contracts? Is there anything new on\nthe horizon that physicians need to be aware of and look out for?\nDennis Hursh: There is nothing new. I think it is just becoming more critical as time goes on. Ten years\nago, I would see the occasional wRVU threshold. I would say even then 90 percent of them were\nproductivity-based. They would pay you your salary no matter what, but if you exceeded the threshold,\nyou would get a bonus. Then it became pretty much that you have to do this to earn your salary. Now I\nthink the big trend is, as you said, quality. The quality should be an independent portion. It should not\nbe dependent on productivity. To a certain extent, they do conflict with each other. If you are\ncompensating me for quality, compensate me for quality. Do not compensate me for quality only as\nlong as I am also grinding out the wRVUs.\nKevin Pho: I think just as important as the wRVU target is the dollar per wRVU that physicians are\ncompensated on. Tell us your thoughts about that. I see from the physician boards that there is a pretty\nbig regional variability when it comes to the dollar per wRVU, and that actually is going to be just as\nimportant as the RVU value number itself, right?\nDennis Hursh: Absolutely. There are benchmarks for that. This is not the kind of thing where you lick\nyour finger and see which way the wind is blowing. There are benchmarks that say for this specialty\nand this region, employed by a hospital or a physician practice, this is the benchmark. There has to be\na really good explanation if they are under the median benchmark.\nKevin Pho: Is there any negotiating wiggle room when it comes to that dollar per wRVU number?\nDennis Hursh: I have gotten it. It is hard because a lot of times they say their department gets a certain\namount of dollars per wRVU and they cannot pay the other physicians less than they are paying you.\nThey say they have to do it. However, sometimes you can negotiate and say that if they are doing that,\nthen the threshold should be smaller. If you are paying less per wRVU, then you should have a\nproportionately smaller threshold.\nKevin Pho: We are talking to Dennis Hursh, health care attorney. Today’s KevinMD article is “wRVU\nthreshold risks in physician contracts.” Dennis, as always, we will end with some takeaway messages\nthat you want to leave with the KevinMD audience.\nDennis Hursh: Just be aware of it. So many people look at it and say they are paying a good salary.\nThey have looked around and talked to other people, and it seems like a good salary. It may not really\nbe a salary. You really have to look at it and make sure it is not in fact a draw against productivity. If it\nis, you have to make sure that it is a reasonable productivity threshold so that you are actually going to\nget paid what they are seemingly promising to pay you.\nKevin Pho: Dennis, as always, thank you so much for sharing your perspective and insight, and thanks\nagain for coming back on the show.\nDennis Hursh: It was my pleasure. Thanks."}

Learn\nhttps://punchng.com/experts-warn-informal-sector-may-derail-tax-reforms/\n\nEconomic watchers have said that the largely informal nature of the Nigerian economy may pose a\nroadblock to the implementation of the new tax reforms, which came into effect this January.\nThis was one of the highlights of a panel discussion at the 2026 Economic Summit organised by the\nEmpowerment Team of the Lagos Province 35 of the Redeemed Christian Church of God on Saturday\nin Lagos.\nThe PUNCH reports that the Moniepoint Informal Economy Report 2025 indicated that Nigeria is home\nto over 39 million Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, accounting for about 96 per cent of all\nbusinesses, contributing 50 per cent to GDP, and employing over 84 per cent of the workforce. Despite\ntheir significant contributions to the economy, the businesses remain informal.\nThis very characteristic of informality is what experts have noted stands in the way of the\nimplementation of the tax reforms, which went into full force this January.\nHighlighting the barrier, the Chief Executive Officer of the Centre for the Promotion of Private\nEnterprises, Dr Muda Yusuf, noted, “One of the things I worry about is that it (tax reforms) looks a bit\nelitist, and it also does not appear to take into account the huge informal economy that we have and the\nlevel of literacy that we have, and that is why there is so much anxiety, despite all the efforts to assure\npeople that it is for their good. Not many people believe, and the communication is also very technical,\nand now you have imposed a burden on people to go and look for consultants, tax consultants, and\npeople to help them keep books; that is an additional burden, and that is the reality.\n“I’m saying that because there’s already a reform fatigue. We are just coming from fuel subsidy reform,\nwe have foreign exchange reform, and we have power sector reform. We have not recovered from that.\nSo, there are issues, because no matter what you say, most of our people who are in Oke-Arin (market\non Lagos Island) or even people who are selling cattle in Kara Market, if you check their turnover\nannually, it will be above the threshold of N100m.\nYou know how much a head of cattle is. So that is, even the man selling cattle in Kara Market has to\npay Company Income Tax. This is not something that is part of our culture of doing business. So, it’s a\nmajor cultural transition. It may be necessary, but whether this is the time to go through it is a different\nmatter.”\nLending voice to the issue of reform fatigue, an economist and the CEO of Financial Derivatives,\nBismarck Rewane, likened it to constipation, saying, “If you eat too many things at the same time, you\nend up constipated. Reform fatigue is the same thing as having images. You’re going to have to pace\nthe reforms and sequence them properly so that you don’t end up with nothing at the end of the day.\nYou have got to prioritise. You cannot do all of the same things at the same time. The removal of fuel\nsubsidy is an increase in tax. That is one item at the end of the day that I pointed out: all of these\nmoney moves from people to the government. If the money is stranded in the government. It has a\nnegative multiplier. So, you must recirculate. I want you to remember that there was a time when we\ncarried out some reforms, and all the money went to what they called SURE-P. SURE-P was static;\nnothing happened. The money was stranded. And that same year, the next year, we had a recession\nbecause the money didn’t come back into the system.\n“So, it’s important that one, taxes are paid; two, that the government recycles it possibly; and three,\nminimises leakages, but doing too much in too little a time frame will give us fatigue, indigestion and\nnegative outcomes.”\nAcknowledging the informality barrier, the Tax Partner at KPMG, Elizabeth Olaghere, said the tax\nreforms have taken it into consideration, with the domestication of the law by state governments\nexpected to drive compliance further.\nShe said, “The ecosystem in Nigeria’s informal sector plays a critical role in the GDP. It’s just that\nmeasuring and capturing the informal sector has its constraints. That constraint is within the tax system.\nThe reforms recognise this and create a special tax framework for companies operating in the informal\nsector, which is called the presumptive tax regime. And under the presumptive tax regime, there are\ngoing to be simplified tax returns for companies that would be operating in the informal sector. So, the\nessence is to create that enabling compliance framework to help small businesses, even medium and\nlarge businesses that Dr Muda mentioned that are still within that ecosystem of the informal sector, but\neasing their compliance warning so they will not necessarily have to have an audited financial\nstatement to file their tax returns. It’s just a way to capture them within that tax net.\n“This presumptive tax system will be simplified. It will not require your normal run-of-the-mill financial\nstatements. The government is still working on guidelines on how this will be implemented, but there’s\ngoing to be an office of the tax ombuds, and this office is going to act as a safeguard to protect the\nrights. There’s also the domestication of the tax reforms by the state government. About nine states\nhave domesticated this. The essence is to eliminate multiple taxes that a lot of informal companies, or\ncompanies in the informal sector, are experiencing. So this should help with the tax compliance\nframework for companies in the informal sector.”\nYusuf added that a risk with the presumptive tax framework for the informal sector is the transfer to the\nfinal customers, because for the businesses, the taxes would be seen as an additional cost, and,\ninvariably, they will pass it on to consumers.\nIn his closing remarks, the pastor in charge of the province and former Director-General of the Budget\nOffice, Ben Akabueze, called for careful calibration of the tax reforms to ensure they achieve their\nobjectives.\nAkabueze said, “It is evident that these reforms are well-intentioned. However, it is often said that the\nroad to hell is paved with good intentions, and this means that even with the best of motives, our\nactions can still have unintended and sometimes disastrous consequences. That’s what we intend: that\nsessions like this can help us provide from both the standpoint of, you know, the drivers of the reform\nand those who are the objects, the targets of the reform. To avail the benefits of the reform incentives\nwill clearly entail some measure of formalisation, and that’s something that we all have to come to\nterms with, lest the benefits of the formalisation outweigh the cost of the formalisation, which includes\nthe cost of registering businesses just to become visible to the system.\n“Unless the benefits outweigh the increased cost. These incentives will simply be ignored by those who\nare supposed to benefit from them. There are apprehensions about the possible resort to bank\nstatements as a basis for taxation. This is something we need to be very careful about so that we will\nnot reverse some of the gains we have made in financial inclusion.”\nOn the reforms generally, the former Budget Office DG said, “The reality is that the reform train has left\nthe station, you know, so we must rise to the challenges of compliance. We must also now become\npoised for what I call fiscal activism, and that means we must all take a keener interest in how our tax\nmoney is spent. Generally, you know, become more active in holding, you know, public funds\naccountable.”"}

This comes at a time when both domestic and global Mexican food peers have made\ninroads in the Indian market.\n“It’s a tough thing to get people to come and dine at your store, but we think that’s a more defensible\nposition to be in. As a growing brand, you don’t want to neglect the dine-in piece,” said the\nentrepreneur, who isn’t worried about rising global and domestic competition in Mexican culinary\nofferings in India. “Our approach has fundamentally been that we want to grow our dine-in channel\nmore. And so our marketing monies were shifted two years ago to focus really on dine-in,” he added.\nCalifornia Burrito currently has 128 stores across five cities – Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Delhi, Gurugram,\nand Chennai – and Mueller said they are set to open 40-45 stores next year, and maybe 50 in the year\nafter that. “As an organisation, we’re focused on city by city, brick by brick, and don’t want to take it too\nwide and fast,” he said.\nMueller spoke to businessline on the sidelines of the “Better Call” Podcast hosted by MudhalVC in\nChennai. Mueller left the US to come start a quaint Mexican food joint in India 14 years ago, and\ndecided to stay back and build a business offering California-style Mexican food to India’s changing\ndemographic.\nCapital for stores\nWith regard to scaling up as a business, Mueller said they are ‘IPO-ready’ but without the need to go\nall-out with store expansion, they do not have the need for the capital. California Burrito has raised\nmoney from angel investors and companies such as Zoho, GoFrugal, and Bengaluru-based SNAM\nGroup. It also has VC firm Elevation Capital on its cap table by way of a secondary transaction.\n“If you see restaurant success stories around the world, I think it’s the nature of the business that\nthere’s a steady pace to it. It’s not a rocket ship business,” the entrepreneur said. The brand has been\ninvited to open outlets globally, but Mueller said he has been resisting since lessons from doing\nbusiness in India may not apply outside India.\nAs for his take on quick commerce, Mueller noted that India is uniquely suited to quick deliveries.\n“Fundamentally, people want opportunities in urban areas. And customers love it. So at the end of the\nday, the market will deliver what the customers want and what the people are willing to give their time to\ndo,” he said.\nAs Indian consumers get more discerning and quality conscious, Mueller says they have been\nsurprised by the love for their brand and its offerings over the years. Within India, different cities have\ndifferent characteristics, he said. “Chennai has more dine-in, Delhi has more delivery. Chennai’s love\nfor California Burrito has been particularly surprising,” he said. The South overall also leans more\ntoward non-vegetarian menu options, he noted.\nAs an American entrepreneur in India, Mueller also weighs in on the recent trajectory of the India-US\nrelations. “I think a lot of people got very unhappy about the tariffs imposed [by US on India], but to me,\nall the stuff with the immigration and H-1Bs is more negative,” he said. “I’m sure Prime Minister\n(Narendra) Modi and President (Donald) Trump are going to come to great terms,” he signed off.\nPublished on January 27, 2026"}

If one can’t pay, whoever is still\nstanding – usually the local council that issued the building consent – picks up the tab.\nVarious governments have in the past considered changing the liability regime to prevent councils from\nbeing left paying for problems they didn’t cause.\nHowever, a sticking point has always been that the Government can’t effectively force the private sector\nto provide warranties/insurance for all building work.\nIn announcing he would still forge ahead with changes, Building and Construction Minister Chris Penk\nexpressed confidence in warranties/insurance being widely available.\nHe never mentioned the fact the Government agreed to empower itself to suspend mandatory\nwarranties/insurance if they weren’t widely available or affordable.\nThe Herald became aware of the caveat in the policy by reading government papers, released some\ntime after Penk announced warranties/insurance would be mandatory.\nCabinet agreed a suspension could be imposed at any time, for up to two years. It could then be\nextended for up to two years.\nThe Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment’s (MBIE) view was that there was capacity in the\nmarket to respond to warranties/insurance being mandatory. It also saw scope for new providers to\nenter the market.\nHowever, Cabinet acknowledged there was always a risk the backers of these products quit the New\nZealand market, as has happened in the past.\n“New Zealand’s insurance market relies on overseas reinsurers, who may withdraw if systemic building\ndefects emerge or following major shocks such as natural disasters,” Penk said in a Cabinet paper.\nTo prevent the building industry from coming to a standstill if the insurance industry retreated, he said\nthe Government needed to be able to push pause on warranties/insurance being mandatory.\nIf a home owner found a defect in their home and their builder went bust, they could be left out of\npocket without a warranty/insurance under the new “proportionate” liability regime.\nUnder the existing “joint and several” liability regime, other parties involved in the build would have to\npay for the problem – hence only around 46% of new builds are currently covered by defects home\nwarranties/insurance.\nEngineers, architects, surveyors and other building industry professionals typically already have\nprofessional indemnity insurance.\nWhile MBIE supported the changes the Government is pushing ahead with, it had a different view after\nconsulting more widely on the matter in 2019.\nIn 2019, MBIE said: “Proportionate liability wouldn’t protect home owners from financial loss, and may\ndeter guarantee and insurance providers from entering the market due to the lower likely recovery of\ndamages from others in the system.\n“Home owners would find it hard to show how much each defendant contributed to their loss. Court\ncosts are likely to increase as the parties dispute their proportion of contribution.”\nIn 2019, MBIE recognised warnings from the industry that it might not be able to provide widespread\ncoverage.\nThe Insurance Council told the ministry: “Currently, builders warranty insurance in New Zealand is sold\nby just two providers that are backed by one syndicate at Lloyd’s of London. It should not be assumed\nthat Lloyd’s will be able to provide further capacity in the future, or even to maintain the current level of\ncapacity.\n“Lloyd’s capacity for this type of long-tail business can vary from year to year and is influenced by\nclaims performance, changes in the global financial markets, and regulatory requirements and\nlegislative changes both here and in the United Kingdom.”\nLloyd’s did in fact exit the market, returning to underwrite an offering by Stamford Insurance.\nIn September Stamford’s founder Duncan Colebrook echoed the 2019 warnings, telling the Herald\nStamford was selective when it came to the building work it insured.\nHe said that if the Government wanted to guarantee consumer protections were in place, it would need\nto provide these itself.\nMaster Builders and Certified Builders – the other two warranty providers (which are self-funded/aren’t\nbacked by Lloyd’s) were open to expanding their coverage.

Officials believe current rates are appropriately\npositioned to support employment while keeping inflatio…\n\nLive Events\nBloomberg\nWall Street Shift\n‘Unusual Times’\nas a Reliable and Trusted News Source Addas a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to halt its interest-rate-cutting cycle this week, as a steadier\njobs market restores a degree of consensus at the central bank after months of growing\ndivision.Several officials, including some close to the chair, have been signaling that rates are now in\nthe right place - after three consecutive cuts - to shore up employment and still keep downward\npressure on inflation.\"They are now essentially within the strike zone of neutral estimates,\" said Josh\nHirt, senior US economist at The Vanguard Group Inc., referring to the level where rates will neither\nrestrain nor stimulate the economy. \"That brings about more caution, less urgency\" for more cuts, he\nsaid.The meeting offers Chair Jerome Powell a chance to direct attention away from the political and\nlegal dramas engulfing the Fed, and back to the central bank's core job of controlling inflation and\nmaximizing employment. Any respite may prove short-lived. The expected decision to hold rates is\nlikely to amplify the outrage of President Donald Trump , who wants them slashed. The Federal Open\nMarket Committee's statement is due at 2 p.m. Wednesday in Washington, and Powell will address\nreporters at 2:30 p.m.His remarks will be scrutinized for hints about how long the Fed might stay on\nhold, what could tilt the balance back toward cuts - and whether the chair has any new moves up his\nsleeve in the fight with Trump.On the economic front, fresh data have helped ease the tensions that\ntore the FOMC in opposite directions over recent months.A sharp slowdown in hiring spooked officials\nwho worried the labor market might be near a tipping point. But another camp remained wary of\ninflation - and pushed back more vociferously with each rate cut. By December, Powell had a\nnear-revolt on his hands, with as many as eight regional Fed presidents in opposition. The split was\nexacerbated by a lack of data due to the government shutdown. Recent readings have taken some of\nthe edge off the debate. Underlying consumer price inflation for the year through December came in at\na less-than-expected 2.6%, helping settle the nerves of policy hawks.On the jobs side, after rising to a\nfour-year high of 4.5% in November, unemployment has ticked back down.Other labor-market gauges\nalso offered reassurance that there's no wave of layoffs in sight, even if hiring is sluggish. \"Overall the\nsituation is not as urgent to require any Fed policy action,\" said Yelena Shulyatyeva, senior US\neconomist at the Conference Board.Investors in the $30 trillion Treasury market have positioned for an\nextended hold on rates. Swap contracts show the next cut is now expected in July, with the potential for\nanother toward the end of the year. Wall Street analysts have pushed their 2026 rate-cut bets into the\nlater part of the year — or, in JPMorgan’s case, scrapped them entirely.“There’s really no convincing\nargument that the Fed needs to really do anything here,” said Gregory Faranello, head of US rates\ntrading and strategy for AmeriVet Securities. “They’re on hold, short term.”Not every policymaker has\nbeen placated. Fed Governor Stephen Miran, who’s on unpaid leave from his post as a senior adviser\nto Trump, has called for 150 basis points in cuts this year. Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman\nsaid officials should avoid signaling the central bank will pause the easing cycle.But the pair appear\nisolated. Other policymakers who’ve spoken since the December gathering have sounded comfortable\nwith leaving rates where they are — including New York Fed President John Williams, whose views are\nseen as closely aligned with Powell’s. Aside from his post-meeting press conferences, Powell hasn’t\nspoken publicly on his policy views since Oct. 14.Even Governor Christopher Waller, who back in June\nwas the first Fed official to advocate for rate cuts, has toned things down. “Because inflation is still up,\nwe can take our time,” he said on Dec. 17, a week after the last meeting.While internal harmony has\nnearly been restored, there’s plenty of external heat.Powell’s post-meeting press conference will be his\nfirst public encounter with reporters since he was served grand jury subpoenas related to a Department\nof Justice investigation. The DOJ is probing the Fed’s ongoing building renovations and Powell’s\ntestimony before Congress last year about the project.The move has rankled several Republican\nlawmakers — and outraged Powell, who blasted the subpoenas as a direct threat to the central bank’s\nability to set interest rates free from “political pressure or intimidation.”His extraordinary response\ntriggered speculation that Powell may choose to remain as a Fed governor even after his tenure as\nchair expires in May. By doing so he would deny Trump another opening on the Board of Governors,\nand potentially undermine the ability of the next chair to influence rates.The Fed chief is sure to get\nquestions about his intentions come May, as well as the DOJ probe and the hearing he attended last\nweek at the Supreme Court over the administration’s attempts to fire Governor Lisa Cook.The political\nsqualls around the Fed are a sign of “unusual times” that could make rate meetings harder to call,\naccording to Darrick Hamilton, an economist at the New School for Social Research.“I don’t expect\nthat’s going to cause the current membership to steer differently than they otherwise would,” he said.\nStill, “pressure is there, and I suspect it will have an impact.”"}

I played around six hours between launch day and a preview event in Los\nAngeles last week. It's got slick gunplay, a neat 3v3 mode that I've never seen anywhere else, and a\nbusiness model that sounds less scummy than most free shooters. It's pretty fun. I don't think I love it.\nI will commend Wildlight Entertainment, the 100-person studio of mostly ex-Respawn devs, for coming\nup with a format so weird (yet functional) that you can't easily compare it. They call it a \"raid shooter,\"\nwhich is appropriate, as winning comes down to blowing the other team's base to smithereens.\nHighgard matches take place on a large map shared by just six total players—two teams of three.\nTeams begin in their fortress, fortify its breakable walls, then mount up and set off to loot the map. This\nphase plays out like an accelerated battle royale match—rushing to find better guns and armor, but\nusually not immediately fighting the other team. Violence tends to break out once the Swordbreaker, a\nliteral sword, spawns in the middle of the map. First team to grab it and carry it to the enemy base\ntriggers a siege.\nUnlike a battle royale circle that forces enemy squads to clash by pushing them toward a center, the\nShieldbreaker naturally draws the lobby to it. Once it appears, getting it is the only thing that matters.\n\"Reverse capture the flag\" was how Wildlight described this first phase of the match, and so far it's my\nfavorite.\nThere's real tension to fighting over the big glowy sword, especially because the distance between the\nShieldbreaker spawn and each base is just large enough that you can die, respawn at your base, and\nset up one last ambush before they reach your walls. Or, you let the other team grab the sword and\nthen chase them down on your mounts.\nOnce a siege starts, Highguard slows down. Mounts are stowed, defenders take up overwatch\npositions, and the rules change to a bomb format similar to Rainbow Six Siege (but with respawns).\nThat's right down to the blend of destructible and non-destructible walls that make up each base. Blow\nup two generators, or one harder-to-reach core, and you win. Fail to do enough damage before\nattackers run out of lives, and both teams reset to do another Shieldbreaker round.\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals Keep up to date with the most important stories\nand the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.

It is complicated, especially when you layer in the upgrade store, gadgets, and\ncharacter abilities I haven't even covered. But I can't deny it works. After a few matches where I barely\nunderstood what was happening, the unique tug-of-war dynamic clicked, I found a Warden (hero) I\nliked, and great matches were had.\n(Image credit: Wildlight Entertainment)\nStill, I'm bouncing off Highguard for reasons other than its clever mode. I don't like the \"arcane punk\" art\nstyle at all, it sucks to dump entire magazines into enemies just to break their shields (just like it does in\nApex Legends), and the siege phase is too chaotic to read what's going on.\nMore than anything though, Highguard is ill-timed for me to enjoy it. For the better part of a year, I've\nbeen glued to more casual, multi-mode shooters both old and new. Case in point: after a full day of\nHighguard in Los Angeles last week, I came home and played hours of new indie arena shooter Out of\nAction (now that's a cool-ass game) before queuing for Big Team Battle in Halo: MCC with friends.\nThe success of Battlefield 6 and Arc Raiders suggest I'm not alone: We're in the middle of a vibe shift\ntoward less sweaty, more social shooters. Call it hero shooter burnout or tastes naturally moving on\nbefore they someday swing back in the other direction, but Highguard is swiping at my matchbook and\nlighting no fire. I'll keep playing because I'm reviewing it (stay tuned for that), but I don't see Highguard\nbecoming a habit."}

Trump’s United States. The most watched\nsporting event on earth is due to be played this year in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and\nGöttlich said in a Friday interview, before a federal agent murdered Minneapolis VA nurse Alex Pretti,\nthat “the time has come” to “seriously consider and discuss this.” Göttlich was responding not only to\nstate agents marauding US streets but also to Trump’s military threats against Greenland and the\npeople of Europe, which have shattered old alliances. However specious these alliances may have\nbeen, the alternative that Trump is advancing is a new world order of unchecked US aggression, where\nthe ghoulish Stephen Miller feels free to call for occupation and bloodshed.\nGöttlich is no lightweight. He is one of the German federation’s 10 vice presidents and the president of\nthe Bundesliga club St. Pauli. Folks may know St. Pauli as a proudly left-wing, openly anti-fascist team\nwhose fans generally align with what Göttlich is putting forward, although calling for a boycott goes\nbeyond what any European soccer power broker has done. It moves the “Overton window” as to where\nthis discussion could go. Göttlich was pressed by a reporter about the St. Pauli players on the German\nnational team and whether he felt like he was undercutting their personal and national ambitions.\nGöttlich replied, “The life of a professional player is not worth more than the lives of countless people in\nvarious regions who are being directly or indirectly attacked or threatened by the World Cup host. What\nwere the justifications for the boycotts of the Olympic Games in the 1980s? By my reckoning the\npotential threat is greater now than it was then. We need to have this discussion.”\nIt is actually past time to have this discussion. Ten long months ago, I wrote a piece with Jules Boykoff\ntitled, “With ICE Out of Control, How Can the US Cohost the 2026 World Cup?” It was a call for\ncountries outside of the United States to boycott. We did not know at the time that the US would\nthreaten war on European soil, abduct world leaders, blow fisher-folk out of the ocean, kidnap\n5-year-olds, and execute US citizens in the streets. And yet even 10 months ago, in the aftermath of\nthe ICE kidnappings of Mahmoud Khalil and Rumeysa Ozturk and the revelations that the US was\nsending people to labor camps in El Salvador, it was clear that the direction of this country would be\ntoward fascist violence.\nOur argument was that countries were being deeply irresponsible by not warning their citizens that\ntraveling to the United States would be perilous and not just for them: players, coaches, and their\nfamilies would all be at risk. Now even FIFA former chief, that monument to corruption Sepp Blatter, is\nsaying that it could be dangerous for fans to travel to the United States. But Göttlich is taking it to the\nnext level by challenging nations to stay home. FIFA, the world governing body for soccer, has\nwitnessed its chief, Gianni Infantino, affect a weak and bent posture when in Trump’s presence. During\nTrump’s second term, Infantino has visited the White House more than any foreign leader and\npresented Trump with that tacky FIFA Peace Prize. Infantino might feel like a world leader when\nparaded around by Trump like a hairless poodle, but his subservience to Trump has created an\nopportunity for Göttlich to be a real leader.\n“As organizations and society, we’re forgetting how to set taboos and boundaries, and how to defend\nvalues,” Göttlich said. “Taboos are an essential part of our stance. Is a taboo crossed when someone\nthreatens? Is a taboo crossed when someone attacks? When people die? I would like to know from\nDonald Trump when he has reached his taboo, and I would like to know from [German soccer chief]\nBernd Neuendorf and Gianni Infantino.”\nWhile Göttlich cited the 1980 Olympic boycott of Moscow following their invasion of Afghanistan, a far\nbetter historical comparison comes from his own backyard: the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Hitler used these\ngames to normalize his Nazi regime and project himself as a leader among world leaders. We can, of\ncourse, look back at that Olympics and revel in classic sports moments like Jesse Owens winning four\ngold medals and ruining Hitler’s dreams of Aryan supremacy.\nBut the deeper story of those games is the shameful decision of countries to travel to Berlin to play for\nthe entertainment of their fascist hosts in the first place. This is not hindsight. There were explosive\ndebates across the globe, particularly the United States, about competing in a Germany already\nimprisoning dissidents and Jews, burning books, and building a military arsenal for territorial expansion.\nOrganizations like the NAACP agitated for a US boycott. The Amateur Athletic Union, by a sliver of a\nvote, ignored their pleas as well as the arguments of others and sent US athletes to compete. These\ndecisions now look obscene. Göttlich is offering countries a way to avoid being depicted as cowards,\nquislings, or villains in the eyes of history. Countries should boycott the World Cup games scheduled to\nbe played in the United States. Ten months ago, they needed to do it for the safety of their own fans.\nNow they must act for the safety of the rest of us.\nOne last note: I went to college in the Twin Cities. I still have many friends in the area. My anger at\nwatching Trump send killers to fill the streets of Minneapolis is personal, but the people there have\nbravely shown that such state violence will be met with a response. Minnesotans aren’t Gianni\nInfantino. Their backs are not bent, and if you ask them to kiss Trump’s ring, they will bite that finger to\nthe bone."}

Peacock’s animated content catalog spans from DreamWorks and\nIllumination to Peacock originals and includes everything from How to Train Your Dragon to Despicable\nMe. After growing that lineup even further in January with the arrival of All Dogs Go to Heaven, Shark\nTale, Shrek Forever After, and more, Peacock is about to lose a criminally underrated animated movie.\nVideos by ComicBook.com\nAfter arriving on the platform on January 1st, DreamWorks’ 2019 animated adventure film Abominable\nis already on the “leaving Peacock soon” list, meaning it will most likely depart by the end of the month.\nThe film was written and directed by Jill Culton and stars Chloe Bennet as the voice of Yi, a\nviolin-playing teenager grappling with her father’s death by isolating herself from her friends and family.\nAfter discovering a young Yeti on her roof, she embarks on a 2,000-mile journey across China to\nreunite him with his family, helping her process her grief along the way.\nDreamWorks’ Abominable Is a Heartwarming Animated Adventure You Need To See\nPlay video\n“Warmer than a Yeti hug” is how ComicBook described Abominable, the type of movie where “once you\nget wrapped up” in its “loving embrace, there’s a good chance you won’t want to leave.” Even\noverlooking the stunning visuals and animation, things that are hallmarks of DreamWorks films,\nAbominable still shines thanks to its surprising emotional depth. The movie manages to balance its\nfamiliar, magical adventure with an exploration of loss and the healing journey and themes of grief,\nfamily, and connection, making it a bittersweet watch that both kids and adults can enjoy.\nUnfortunately, Abominable had a monumental hill to climb. It followed other forgettable creatures in the\nsnow movies like Smallfoot and Norm of the North and was released amid a wave of highly anticipated\nanimated films in 2019 like Toy Story 4, Frozen II, and How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World,\nand it easily got buried in the mix. Despite its “Certified Fresh” critic score on Rotten Tomatoes of 83%\nand a “Verified Hot” audience rating of 95%, making it a Top 20 DreamWorks film, the movie only\ngrossed $188 million worldwide, which, while impressive, still put it in the bottom half of DreamWorks’\nbox office rankings, and it’s largely been forgotten in the years since.\nWhere to Stream Abominable After It Leaves Peacock?\nAbominable may become as elusive as the fabled Yeti itself. The movie doesn’t currently stream\noutside of Peacock, so it’s possible Abominable may be set to stop streaming altogether after its\ndeparture from the NBCUniversal streamer. The movie has appeared on different streaming platforms\nover the years, and the streaming landscape is constantly shifting, so fans may be able to catch it on a\ndifferent service at some point in the future, but only time will tell. In the meantime, fans hoping to watch\nAbominable still have some time left to catch it on Peacock, and the film will still be available to rent or\nbuy online.\nWhat do you think?

With three of the top five\nhighest-grossing films of all time directed by him, there’s nobody else quite at his level. But it’s taken\nsome hard work, and possibly some hurt feelings, to get there. And Cameron admits to not liking the\nperson he used to be on set.\nCameron recently appeared on In Depth with Graham Bensinger, where he spoke at length about his\ncareer. The host asked him about previous comments he had made that amounted to the director not\nliking the way he tended to act while directing. Cameron admitted there was a time when he had a\ntendency to be so focused on getting the movie made right, that he took even the slightest hindrance to\nthat personally. He explained…\nI think, in the early days, where I did put the film first above all things, there were interactions I would\nhave that I would feel guilty about later. At that time, I had a righteous sense of having been aggrieved\nby someone who was supposed to do something and didn’t do it, and it was compromising the art. It\nwas compromising the film. And I was the person responsible for getting that film made. So then that\nperson became — I don’t want to say my enemy — but they became a problem.\nFilm is certainly a collaborative medium, but the director is the one in charge, and it seems Cameron\nmay have taken that a little too much to heart in the past. It sounds like those working with him might\nrun afoul of the director’s temper from time to time, as Cameron had little patience for mistakes on set.\nAlthough it did appear to work, considering the best James Cameron movies are among the most\nsuccessful movies ever made.\nHowever, Cameron says he’s worked hard to change that mentality and thinks he’s now found a good\nbalance. He understands that blaming people doesn’t make the movie better and is more tolerant of\nmistakes because he knows they can be dealt with. He continued…\nIt’s taken a long time to unwind that, and I don’t think that way anymore, now. I think, ‘OK, if we’re a\ngood enough team, we can take up and compensate for any mistake that has happened, and blame\ndoesn’t help. So I’ve completely rewritten my programming of how I interact with everybody on my\nteam. And I think we have a good kind of familial feeling around the team. People feel good about their\nwork. It’s a very sort of communal effort.\nThe specific case of Kate Winslet is brought up, as the actress famously said some less-than-stellar\nthings about Cameron as a director following Titanic. Cameron takes exception to that specific case,\nwhile he doesn’t specifically claim that things didn’t happen as the actress claimed, he doesn’t feel that\nher comments were entirely descriptive of the experience of making Titanic with him.

Two Members\nQuit Minnesota Metalcore Band Reflections Over “ICE Apologist” Singer Heavy Consequence Staff\n\nTwo members of the Minnesota metalcore act Reflections have quit the band, with one of them\naccusing the singer of being an “ICE apologist.”\nBassist Francis Xayana and guitarist Patrick “Patty” Somoulay, who co-founded the band with frontman\nJake Wolf, have exited Reflections while calling out the singer on their way out.\nThe band is based in the Twin Cities, where tensions are high following the shooting deaths of two\ncivilians at the hands of ICE this month.\nOn his Instagram stories, Xayana wrote the following regarding his exit:\n“Jake has always had control of the band. There’s a reason Patty left even though he is the primary\nwriter. Jake is an ICE apologist and I will not fuck with someone like that. I don’t give a flying fuck what\nwe’ve been through. I cannot trust a person who thinks this is necessary. And honestly fuck you if you\nsupport this ICE shit. You’re a fucking bitch. And instead of getting into your fucking feelings y’all should\nhave been listening to Black voices this entire time. Now when a white person is killed in the same form\nthey’ve experienced for centuries, we are at end game. There is no going back. This is the beginning of\nthe end if people continue to turn a blind eye. He’s going to kill anyone who opposes him.”\nSomoulay shared the following message on his social media pages:\n“I am no longer a part of Reflections. A lot of stuff happening in life lately where it just does not feel\nokay to continue on with this myself. Also f**k ICE. This isn’t the country my family wanted to risk their\nlives to come to.”\nWolf has yet to make any statements regarding his bandmates’ exits. His Instagram only has one post\ncurrently, a poster for the band’s upcoming appearance at a European music festival taking place in\nSeptember.\nRelated Video\nReflections have released five studio albums and three EPs since forming in 2010. At one point, they\nwere signed to eOne Records, but their last couple albums have been self-released.\nSee screen grabs of Francis Xayana’s IG stories (via ThePRP), as well as Patrick “Patty” Somoulay’s\nIG post, below."}

He is a successful author, and had been given the speakers as a gift for his writing (as have I\nbeen rewarded with branded water bottles for my writing).\nThe speakers stood over us like Easter Island statues as we talked. Eventually, over lunch, he turned\nthem on and I waited for the choirs of heaven to pour out. The sound was… good. I enjoyed listening to\nMotown as we ate rice bowls, and while I am by no means an acoustic engineer, I wasn’t floored by a\nstaggering difference in sound quality. (Audiophiles, strike me dead!)\nI had some time to mull it over as I returned to my house and my daily work, thinking about why people\nspend money the way they do. What possible need could these speakers fill?\nA few options as I see it (all of them assume you have many millions of dollars):\n– You are a professional sound person and use this for work. It’s the equivalent of a graphic designer\nbuying a huge Mac desktop computer—tool of the trade.\n— You find special joy in listening to landmark albums like Glenn Gould’s recording of Bach: Goldberg\nVariations and you’re driven to have an experience that feels like you’re sitting next to the piano.\n– Last option, you’re anxious that you might not have the best and plunking down $270,000 reassures\nyour brain that, yes, this is the best. Buying these speakers soothes the fear that your subwoofer might\nbe subpar.\nIt made sense to me suddenly, the fabulously expensive home stereo stores I used to walk by on Park\nAvenue in Manhattan. I wondered why, specifically, is there such a market for infinitely expensive home\nsound systems? And then it occurred to me that sound quality, like wine and art, is a highly subjective\nrealm.\nMost people want to consider themselves as having good taste, and no one wishes to look like a fool.\nSo when you’re standing next to someone who’s an expert in wine or audio systems, aren’t you\ntempted to agree when they ask if you also can detect “barnyard” notes in this glass of Merlot or the\n“rich, honeyed” sound from that nice-looking speaker over there?\nIn guiding you to the conclusion that you have the best sound system, the expert can resolve a pain\nworse than listening to music out of your iPhone—the pain of having spent your money wrong. When\nyou aren’t clear on what’s excellent, a big price tag can serve as a proxy for quality.\nIt might sound like I’m dunking on well-heeled wine or music lovers, but I’m not. One of the first jobs\nthat I was unqualified to hold was as a waiter at a wine bar after college, where I learned a lot about\nwine. I still love a nice Tempranillo. And I relish the Thursday live broadcast from Carnegie Hall on\nWQXR (albeit through my comparatively pathetic $120 speaker).\nBut there’s a difference between using your money to love and enjoy good things and using your\nmoney to dispel the anxiety that you might not have the best. One reason why there’s almost no ceiling\non hard-to-measure goods like home stereos or wine is that, for people with enormous means, there's\nalways the promise of something better, something rarer that you might be able to get your hands on.\nMaybe you're a connoisseur, sampling Pinot Noirs from Oregon's volcanic soil, which is great because\nyou love the journey. But buyer beware, the search for the best is different than the search for\nsomething you love.\nWorried about money? You're not alone.

They said that they reported\nFont de Mora now after learning that he was back on the tour, out of concern for Stearns’ well-being, as\nwell as that of other players.\nFont de Mora has denied any wrongdoing. Stearns, who lost to Amanda Anisimova Saturday in the\nthird round of the Australian Open, spoke highly of Font de Mora earlier in the week.\nShriver’s complaint relates to Font de Mora’s relationship with a player he coached in the 1990s and\nearly 2000s in Arizona starting when she was 13.\nThe player, Meghann Shaughnessy, separated herself from her family to move into Font de Mora’s\nhouse, along with other tennis players, when she was 14 and he was 25. When she was 19, they\nbecame engaged. Shriver’s career ended just as Shaughnessy’s was beginning. Shriver’s coach, Don\nCandy, who died in 2020, was 50 and Shriver was 17 when their relationship moved beyond coaching.\nShriver has said she now understands that the relationship, which lasted five years, was sexually and\nemotionally abusive.\nShe observed Font de Mora and Shaughnessy’s relationship in her capacity as a television broadcaster\nafter she retired.\nShriver remains active in the sport, most recently as a broadcaster and coach. While in Melbourne for\nthis year’s event, she said she passed Font de Mora in one of the tournament hotels, and then informed\nthe WTA about his history.\nFont de Mora has said that his relationship with Shaughnessy was platonic until she turned 18, but\naccording to reports at the time, Shaughnessy’s parents twice tried to remove her from his coaching.\nConcerns that the relationship was “inappropriate” also influenced a USTA decision not to award\nShaughnessy funding, according to a source close to the organization. Font de Mora and Shaughnessy\nnever married, and they ended their relationship in 2005.\nShaughnessy has not alleged any wrongdoing by Font de Mora and declined to be interviewed for this\nstory beyond confirming that she and Font de Mora never married.\nShriver’s complaint submitted to the WTA Tour does not add new information to what was already\nknown about Shaughnessy and Font de Mora’s relationship.\nThe second complaint, from the player who requested anonymity, concerns Font de Mora’s conduct as\nher coach. The player worked with Font de Mora early in her career.\nShe said he exhibited aggressive, physically and verbally abusive behavior toward her, including\nswearing in her face and hitting balls aggressively in her direction. Her account was broadly\ncorroborated to The Athletic by a third player who also worked with Font de Mora.\nIn addition to reporting official complaints to the WTA Tour, Shriver also filed a complaint with the U.S.\nCenter for SafeSport, which oversees athlete safety. SafeSport did not respond to a request for\ncomment, and generally does not comment on complaints.\nFriday, Font de Mora responded to questions about the complaints via email, in which he copied civil\nattorney Karen Moskowitz.\n“Your questions are statements that are not true,” he wrote. “I coordinate my training and sprints with\nprofessional trainers and biomechanist(s) and I am a very positive coach.”\nFont de Mora also said that contacting Stearns and Kathryn Whartenby, Stearns’ trainer, would give “an\nexact idea” of his methods. He provided their contact details.\nThe Athletic has asked Whartenby for comment, and will update this story if she responds. Font de\nMora also advised contacting Stearns’ mother to see how happy she was with his training methods.\nShe did not respond when contacted via text message.\nDuring an interview Thursday, after Stearns’ second-round win over Petra Mar■inko, Font de Mora, 57,\nhad said he could not discuss the complaints to the WTA Tour because he had not been told about\nthem.\nHe said he has known Stearns since she was around 10, and has advised and occasionally coached\nher since then. He will now travel with her full-time on the WTA Tour, after a training block ahead of the\n2026 season.\nIn a news conference after her win Thursday, Stearns said that she met Font de Mora when she was 12\nand began hitting intermittently at his academy in Glendale, Ariz.\nBefore that news conference, Stearns’ representative, Enric Molina, communicated through tour\nrepresentatives that Stearns did not wish to be asked specific questions about Font de Mora’s behavior\nand past relationships with players.\nAsked during it whether she was familiar with his history on the WTA Tour, Stearns, the 2022 NCAA\nchampion and world No. 68, said: “Yeah, I mean, it’s been around, but, I think right now, just not really\ngoing to dive into that, no comment.”\nShe said Font de Mora had pushed her to focus on herself more during her time working with him.\n“One thing he’s been big on is, you know, what can you control?” she said of Font de Mora’s coaching.\n“You know, I can’t control the wind today, so what are you going to do? What can you control about it?\nYou can control your attitude, you can control your emotions, you can control how intense your feet are,\nyou know, get to the ball because it’s windy.\n“That’s been huge because it’s not about the results,” she said.\nThe complaints are being handled by Lindsay Brandon, the WTA’s director of safeguarding, according\nto two sources briefed on the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly.\nFor years, the tour largely stayed out of player-coach relationships, but it has recently taken a more\nproactive approach to complaints. Penalties for complaints upheld by the WTA Tour can include\ncoaching education programs, revocation of tournament credentials, and bans from tournament sites\nand facilities.\nIn 2025, the WTA banned Stefano Vukov, the coach of 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina, for\none year after finding that he engaged in “abuse of authority and abusive conduct” toward her. Vukov,\nwho denied wrongdoing, appealed the ban. It was lifted last summer after arbitration.\nThe WTA does not disclose complaints it receives, nor how many are upheld. At the time of writing, the\nU.S. Center for SafeSport’s Disciplinary Database lists 102 individuals in tennis subject to sanctions.\nTheir sanctions range from restrictions on contact to permanent ineligibility to coach.\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the WTA said: “Reports and investigations into alleged violations of\nthe WTA Code of Conduct and Safeguarding Code are confidential and not subject to public disclosure.\n“When the WTA receives such a report, it takes the matter seriously and follows its established rules\nand procedures in accordance with the WTA Safeguarding Code.”\nThe player who worked with Font de Mora early in her career said that he verbally and physically\nabused her, including swearing in her face and hitting balls aggressively in her direction.\nShe also said that Font de Mora proposed a contract that would have had him take significantly more\nthan the 10 percent of prize money, and 20 percent of sponsorships, that is typical in player-coach\ncontracts. The player declined the contract after being advised that this wasn’t proportionate. These\nexperiences led her to stop working with Font de Mora.\nShe also described Font de Mora engaging in similar abusive conduct toward other players.\nA third player, who has not made a complaint but was being coached by Font de Mora at the same\ntime, corroborated her description of abuse.\nShe also said that Font de Mora exercised coercive control over her, limiting her contact with family\nmembers. He would keep players on his side by swinging from being verbally abusive to being\nsupportive or overly generous after a session. The player who made the complaint recalled this pattern\nas well.\nThe third player, who was in her mid-teens at the time, described sessions in which players were\nworked until they were on the verge of physical collapse. She said that no other coach made her play\nas long or as underfueled, and that Font de Mora’s training was more extreme than any other coach’s.\nThe player who made the complaint described similar experiences. She said she was kept on court for\nfar longer than with other coaches before or since. They were also made to do punitive sprints for\nmissed shots, both players said, including in extreme weather conditions, the player who made the\ncomplaint said.\nThe third player also said Font de Mora would make frequent comments about her weight. The coach\ncontrolled her diet, she said, and she developed an eating disorder while working with him.\nShe said the subsequent decision to stop working with Font de Mora was in part made by her parents,\nwho the player said were deliberately sidelined by the coach so he could have more control. Her\nmother, reached via text message, corroborated the player’s statements regarding control of her diet,\nand her statement that she developed an eating disorder with Font de Mora. She also corroborated her\nand the player’s father being sidelined by Font de Mora.\n“He does have good drills and is a competent coach,” the player said.\n“But the path he left behind in terms of destruction of people’s lives is pretty significant,” she said, in\nreference to her experiences and those of other players who told her that their careers suffered badly\nafter working with Font de Mora.\nA different coach, who the player who made the complaint to the WTA worked with later in her career,\nrecalled her being “shellshocked” by her experience with Font de Mora shortly after she stopped\nworking with him, though he did not recall specific details of Font de Mora’s conduct.\nBy early 2022, Font de Mora was coaching Kylie McKenzie, a once-promising junior who was allegedly\nsexually assaulted by another coach at the USTA Training Center in Orlando in 2018. The coach,\nAnibal Aranda, was not prosecuted, but the USTA fired him.\nMcKenzie sued the USTA for failing to protect her. In May 2024, a civil jury awarded McKenzie $9\nmillion in compensatory and punitive damages, to be paid by the USTA. The organization has appealed\nthe ruling.\nAfter McKenzie stopped training with the USTA, she returned home to Arizona and began training in\nGlendale, at Font de Mora’s academy, ITUSA.\nIn the winter of 2022, Font de Mora sent McKenzie a document, entitled “Kylie Options — Trying to find\nsolutions to continuous attitude issues.”\nIn the document, which The Athletic has reviewed, Font de Mora outlined four options for continuing\ntheir coaching partnership, three of which involved payments of hundreds of thousands of dollars.\nThe fourth involved a legal dispute about owed earnings, which Font de Mora wrote could include\n“potential breach of non-disclosure settlement with the USTA” if the matter went to court.\nIt is not clear, on the face of that letter, what Font de Mora meant. But in response, McKenzie retained\nan attorney, Bob Allard. Allard interpreted Font de Mora’s reference to “potential breach of\nnon-disclosure settlement with the USTA” as a threat to bring litigation that would result in public\ndisclosure of the details of McKenzie’s alleged sexual assault at the USTA Center, which at the time\nwere confidential.\nIn February of 2022, Allard sent Font de Mora a cease and desist letter, terminating Font de Mora’s\nprofessional relationship with McKenzie, “especially due to a recent extortion and/or blackmail attempt\nthat was recently made.”\nThere was no further contact between Font de Mora and McKenzie, who did not allege the kind of\nabusive conduct claimed by other players.\nDuring Stearns’ match Thursday, with the American and Marcinko battling through a tight second set,\nFont de Mora had words of encouragement and criticism after nearly every point.\nSometimes it was instructive. “Body forehands,” he advised her before some of her serves.\n“That’s so good,” he told her after she won points; “You love this,” he reminded her when she lost them.\n“You have to be aggressive … Compete with her … Come on … Compete,” he said.\nStearns remains in the doubles competition in Melbourne. She and Hailey Baptiste are scheduled to\nplay No. 4 seeds Zhang Shuai and Elise Mertens in the third round Tuesday.\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\nTennis, Women's Tennis\n2026 The Athletic Media Company"}

Bafta is the final major organisation\nto reveal its shortlists in this year's film awards season, following the announcement of the Oscar\nnominations last week. Hamnet, Sinners and One Battle After Another are expected to lead the field,\nbut KPop Demon Hunters will miss out due to eligibility rules. Many of the films in contention are the\nsame as the Oscars, but there will be more UK representation at the Baftas, which has categories\ndedicated to recognising British talent.\nBafta are also able to recognise slightly more films and actors than the Oscars, as they have six slots\navailable in many categories instead of five. Alan Cumming will host the Bafta Film Awards in London\non Sunday 22 February. Here's everything you need to know ahead of the nominations:\nWhich films are the frontrunners?\nGetty Images One Battle stars (left to right) Sean Penn, Chase Infiniti, Leonardo DiCaprio, Teyana\nTaylor and Benicio del Toro\nWe know there are a lot of award ceremonies to keep track of at this time of year and you might be tired\nof reading about the same films over and over again. But in case you're only just joining the awards\nrace, here's a quick cheat sheet of which films have the most longlist mentions at the Bafta Film\nAwards, and what they're about: One Battle After Another follows a former revolutionary who reunites\nwith his old crew to get back his daughter after her kidnap by a white supremacist group Hamnet,\nbased on Maggie O'Farrell's novel, explores the idea that a family tragedy led William Shakespeare to\nwrite one of his most famous plays Sinners, a blend of vampire horror and blues music, sees twin\nbrothers set out to open a new live entertainment venue in 1930s Mississippi, before their plans are\nderailed by an evil force Marty Supreme tells the story of a young table-tennis player in 1950s New\nYork, trying to make his name as an athlete while staying financially afloat Bugonia follows two cousins\nwho kidnap and hold captive the CEO of a pharmaceutical company, who they hold responsible for the\ndeath of a relative Frankenstein is a new take on Mary Shelley's 1818 novel about a mad professor who\nbuilds a new creature from human body parts, only to later abandon it Sentimental Value sees two\nsisters reconnect with their estranged father, a film director planning his comeback, after the death of\ntheir mother Wicked: For Good concludes the story of how Elphaba, the wicked witch of the west,\nbecame school friends with Glinda the good witch, before the events of 1939's The Wizard of Oz\nBrit pack\nGetty Images Carey Mulligan, Harry Melling and Robert Aramayo could all be nominated despite\nmissing out at other film awards\nAlthough the major contenders are likely to overlap with the Oscars, there will be much more British\nrepresentation at the Baftas. British and Irish actors often perform better on their own soil, plus there\nare categories dedicated to outstanding British debut and outstanding British film, in addition to best\noverall film. Likely nominees include I Swear, the uplifting story of a young man with Tourette's growing\nup in 1980s Scotland, and the humorous and heartwarming The Ballad of Wallis Island, about an\neccentric lottery winner trying to bring his favourite musical duo back together. Other British films in\ncontention include Pillion, a superb film about two men in a BDSM relationship, and the terrific screen\nadaptation of H is for Hawk, about a woman who buys and trains a goshawk while grieving her father's\ndeath. The other films longlisted for outstanding British film are The Choral, 28 Years Later, Ballad of a\nSmall Player, Die My Love, Hamnet, Steve, Goodbye June, Warfare, Mr Burton, The Roses and Bridget\nJones: Mad About The Boy. Many of the British and Irish stars who appear in those films could also\nscore individual acting nominations, despite not showing up elsewhere in awards season. They include\nCillian Murphy (Steve), Carey Mulligan (The Ballad of Wallis Island), Harry Melling (Pillion), Emily\nWatson (Hamnet), Robert Aramayo and Pete Mullan (I Swear), and Andrea Riseborough and Brenda\nBlethyn (Dragonfly). Other British actors in the running include Sinners stars Wunmi Mosaku and\nDelroy Lindo - both of whom were recognised in the supporting categories at the Oscar nominations\nlast week.\nWhy won't KPop Demon Hunters be nominated?\nNetflix KPop Demon Hunters will miss out as it was deemed ineligible by Bafta\nBafta announcing their longlists in advance also means we already know about several films and actors\nthat definitely will not be nominated on Tuesday. Some Hollywood A-listers such as Julia Roberts,\nDwayne Johnson, George Clooney and Sydney Sweeney had films out this year, but all missed out on\nthe Bafta longlist, as they did at the Oscars. The Secret Agent star Wagner Moura is also not longlisted\nat Bafta, despite being nominated at most other major awards ceremonies including the Oscars.\nPerhaps the most notable omission, however, is KPop Demon Hunters - the Netflix smash that was the\nbiggest viral film hit of last year. It is the frontrunner in the animated and original song categories at the\nOscars, but it's ineligible at the Baftas as it opened straight to Netflix in the UK without a preceding\ntheatrical run (although a singalong version was released in cinemas later).\nWhat do the Baftas tell us about the Oscar race?\nGetty Images Irish actors Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal were both longlisted for their performances\nin Hamnet"}

But the film finally\nbecame reality thanks in part to Segan’s role in the 2019 hit film “Knives Out” and the relationship he\nbuilt with its director, Rian Johnson.\nSegan told TheWrap at the Sundance Film Festival that while playing a comic relief cop investigating\nthe murder of famed author Harlan Thrombey, he told Johnson that he was working on a film of his own\nand let him be the first person to read the script about a Big Apple pickpocket feeling out of place in an\nincreasingly digital world.\n“We’ve been friends for so long, worked together for so long, and he said, ‘You know, if ‘Knives Out’\ndoes well, then we might be in a position where we could start a company that would produce movies\nand, you know, maybe produce a movie like this.’ Well, it took eight years, but here we are!”\nIndeed, the success of “Knives Out” and the $468 million deal Johnson inked with Netflix to release two\nsequels led to the founding of his production company, T-Street, which is attached to “The Only Living\nPickpocket in New York.”\nAs part of his preparation to play the lead in “Only Pickpocket,” actor John Turturro went through\nseveral books on pickpockets given to him by Segan, who jokingly called it the “oldest profession.” In\nreading the material, Turturro learned that there really is honor among thieves … or at least a code …\nand in absorbing the history was able to settle into his role as a man who had been hustling in New\nYork since the ’80s and now felt as if the world was leaving him behind.\n“There was one book in particular called ‘Wiz Mob’ that was written by a sociologist who interviews all\nthese people, and you hear it in their own words,” Turturro said. “Charles Dickens wrote about\npickpockets. In ‘Oliver Twist,’ all the kids learn how to be pickpockets and there’s this sort of code they\nhave.”\n“As I was writing the script and researching, I was like, ‘Oh, these are like movie people. They have\ntheir code, and they kind of stick together, and they kind of have a weird way of doing stuff, but it works\nin their own way,’” added Segan.\nWhile American productions have been fleeing to other countries left and right for tax incentives, “The\nOnly Living Pickpocket in New York” was able to take advantage of New York’s expanded film tax\nincentive to shoot in all five boroughs of the city, joining recent films like Spike Lee’s “Highest 2\nLowest,” Darren Aronofsky’s “Caught Stealing” and Josh Safdie’s “Marty Supreme.”\nFor T-Street producer Leopold Hughes, it was the most freeing experience he’s had shooting a film in\nsome time.\n“Shooting in New York, and especially a low budget movie, I would do it again in a heartbeat,” he said.\n“One thing I’ve never, ever done in my career, which has been amazing, is I’ve always had playback,\nand we did not have that on this movie, and I think I might want to bring that back for every movie.”"}

Tolkien’s fantasy world. LEGO has been releasing new LOTR sets for years now, but\nmost of them have been stuck at a higher price point until now. The new LEGO Icons The Lord of The\nRings: Sauron’s Helmet set is only $69.99, a very accessible price tag for builders hoping to add an\nimpressive LEGO centerpiece to their collection. It’s also important to note that this set completely\nencapsulates the evil aura that Sauron emanates. The helmet has black glossy eyes that create a\nsoulless look, and while the whole set is grey, its filled with sharp edges and long, thin pieces, adding to\nthe ancient evil feeling of the leader of Mordor. Plus, the set even includes a Sauron mini-figure,\ncomplete with the One Ring wrapped around his little LEGO hand.\nWant more like this? Get the latest drops, ratings, reviews, and more with the ComicBook Gear Review\nnewsletter — straight to your inbox.\nVideos by ComicBook.com\nAt 538 pieces, the set is completely doable for new builders while still being a strong addition to any\nThe Lord of the Rings collection. It stands at 13 inches tall, with a width and depth of 5 inches. Avid\ncollectors can find the new set up for pre-order here at LEGO.com or here at Amazon, where it’ll be\navailable and shipped on March 1st.\nMore The Lord of the Rings LEGO Sets Available Now\nIf your favorite thing about The Lord of the Rings is the amazing, fantastical environments, and if you\nhave some extra cash sitting around, then you’re in luck. Some of the best LoTR sets are still available\non Amazon and the LEGO store. The most expensive and the most expansive of the bunch is the The\nLord of The Rings: Rivendell set, a 6167 piece set that brings to life a brick version of the Elven\nsettlement Rivendell. Not only does the set do a great job with the beautiful fantasy environment, it also\nincludes 15 mini-figures, including Frodo, Bilbo, Arwen, and Aragorn. However, at $499.99, this set is\nthe most expensive of all the LoTR sets available, so make sure it won’t be breaking the bank. You can\nfind it on Amazon right here.\nIf the colorful Rivendell is too uplifting for you, you can also find the The Lord of the Rings: Barad-dur\nset available on backorder at the LEGO store or available for purchase on Amazon. This one is only\n$459.99, making it cheaper than the Rivendell set. It’s made up of 5471 pieces and includes 10\nmini-figures, including Sauron, Mouth of Sauron, an Orc, Frodo, Sam, and Gollum and Gothmog. The\nDark Tower also stands impressively tall at 33 inches, with a width of 18 inches and a depth of 12,\nmaking it imposingly massive. The eye at the top of the tower is even illuminated with a special brick,\nmaking it impressively bright and a great centerpiece or the whole thing.\nThe Lord of the Rings continues to be one of the most beloved fantasy franchises of all time, so it only\nmakes sense that LEGO has continued to shower it with love and new sets. With the new The Lord of\nthe Rings: The Hunt for Gollum set to premiere in 2027, it seems a new breath of life has been\nbreathed into the franchise, and more movies are probably coming in the future. There’s even\nspeculation that fan favorite Elijah Wood will appear again as Frodo Baggins, awesome news for fans\n(but, notably, a bit of the Marvel formula is being used here). However, Viggo Mortensen’s Aragorn is\nprobably going to be recast in a move meant to make a the prequel appearance of the character more\nbelievable. We’ll see if this is a good move for the movie in the long run. Others have already\nexpressed fear that the movie will run into the same issues that Disney’s Solo did with Alden\nEhrenreich as the fan-favorite character Han Solo.\nWhile these decisions are still being made, I for one am excited to see the franchise continue. Let’s just\nhope it continues in a way that is strong for the narrative as a whole, and not just for the money-making\ngoals of Amazon Studios.\nWant to stay up to date with the latest The Lord of the Rings news and collectibles?

The aim has been to improve on how we\npronounce words. Today, we are building on what I hope has been achieved by looking at the concept\nof intonation in English. While speech sounds are primarily connected to the pronunciation of words\nand syllables, intonation applies more to the articulation of clauses or sentences. Mastering it will\nstrengthen and beautify your elocution.\nWhat is intonation? It refers to the rise and fall of pitch in the voice. This means that when we are\nspeaking, not all parts of clauses or sentences should be on the same level. While some should rise\nand fall towards the end, others should rise by the final point. This is what gave birth to different types\nor patterns of intonation that include rising and falling. For the purpose of teaching/learning, the\npatterns are indicated with arrows. In actual speech, however, the pitch is expected to naturally fall or\nrise. When the arrow goes downwards, it means the pitch falls but when it faces up, it means it rises.\nConsider:\nWe will do it later . (Downwards)\nIs the money complete . (Up)\nI can’t re collect. (Rising and falling)\nHe didn’t come. Did he?\nYou didn’t damage it. Did you?”\nFunctions of intonation\nIntonation gives sentences rhythm and variety. It makes language sweet in the ear. In other words, it\nmakes it flow even if not exactly like music. On the other hand, intonation imbues sentences with\nvariety in the sense that a single clause may have different meanings as the spoken patterns change.\nIntonation is used to convey meaning\nThrough a particular intonation pattern, meaning is better established. This indicates that it is not\nthrough vocabulary alone that communication comes through. The pitch of the voice is also a vehicle.\nPlacing emphasis on an aspect of the message\nVariation in the pitch could also point to the aspect you want the listener to note more. That is how\nstress and intonation are twin concepts in English:\nIntonation conveys emotion and attitude\nThe speaker often expresses a particular emotion about the subject of their speech and intonation\nhelps to achieve this. This is particularly important where the speaker and listener are not together, in\nwhich case the latter cannot see the speaker’s gestures. With the rising and falling of intonation, the\nlistener can deduce the speaker’s emotion.\nConsider this expert’s view in terms of the functions of intonation: It clarifies meaning (e.g.,\ndistinguishing a question from a statement), adds emphasis to specific words (stress), and indicates the\nspeaker’s emotions like sarcasm, anger, or politeness.\nWe shall conclude the topic next week by looking at types of intonation.\nTo be continued"}

The event generated nearly five million streaming views, posted a 4.96 million live\naverage minute audience during the main card, and peaked at 5.93 million concurrent streams.\nNotably, those figures do not include co-viewing.\nIn an official press release, Paramount+ labeled UFC 324 its “largest exclusive live event to date,” an\nimpressive milestone considering the platform has streamed thousands of live events since its launch.\nA major driver behind the massive audience was accessibility. UFC 324 was available to Paramount+\nseismic shift in how the promotion distributes its biggest events. For fans, it removed a significant\nbarrier. For the UFC, it opened the door to a much wider audience.\nFrom an entertainment standpoint, the card delivered. The five-round main event war between Justin\nGaethje and Paddy Pimblett lived up to the hype and should remain in the “Fight of the Year”\nconversation for months to come (watch highlights).\nThe event also dominated social media. UFC 324 was the most social event of the night across all\nbroadcast, cable, and streaming platforms, generating 5.5 million social interactions for the main event\nalone. It became the most social Paramount+ exclusive telecast ever, trended No. 1 worldwide on X for\nsix straight hours, and logged 186,000 total mentions — a 127 percent increase compared to UFC 323.\nStill, the debut wasn’t without criticism. Fans loudly voiced frustrations over frequent ad interruptions\nthroughout the broadcast. UFC CEO Dana White addressed the issue, explaining that with the loss of\ntraditional pay-per-view revenue, advertising was always going to be part of the equation given the\nplatform’s reported $7.7 billion rights investment. That said, White emphasized “these guys are\nincredible to work with already, so we’ll figure it out.”"}

Already, pundits have started calling him a lame duck, a\nterm typically saved for the third year of a presidency, which might partly explain the vigorous flurry of\nactivity he has undertaken in Nigeria, Venezuela, Minneapolis, Greenland, and beyond. He has gamely\nentertained discussions about whether Marco Rubio or J. D. Vance will succeed him, which in one\nsense is an acknowledgment of his mortality. In another sense, the succession represents a way for\nhim to live forever — a conceit, I soon learned, that was perpetuated by the bubble of loyalists and\nsupplicants and advisers that constantly surrounds him and that seemed indicative of the late-empire\nstage of Trump’s decade-plus-long dominance of American life…\nRather than change, Trump tends to force the world to adapt to him. If there was a conspiracy of\nsilence protecting Joe Biden when questions arose about his mental and physical decline, there’s a\ncacophony around Trump. Numerous members of his inner circle have clamored to tell me tales of the\npresident’s godlike virility. “He can work harder and he has a better memory and he has more stamina\nand has more energy than a normal mortal,” deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told me. “The headline\nof your story should be ‘The Superhuman President.’”\n“I feel the same as I did 40 years ago,” he said, settling in behind the Resolute desk. Warm afternoon\nlight from the window illuminated his famous hair, once dyed golden and now its natural white — his\n“only concession to age,” one of his senior staffers told me. In person, Trump looks trimmer than he\ndoes on television, though he denies he’s ever been on a GLP-1 or, as he calls it, “the fat drug.” (His\nlast physical, this past April, listed him as weighing 224 pounds, but he told me he’s currently “about\n235.”) He stands a little hunched and his eyes are puffy, but he looks pretty good for a 79-year-old. His\nhearing, according to a senior staff member, isn’t what it used to be (the staffer doesn’t think Trump has\nnoticed this about himself, despite regularly leaning in and requesting people speak up). His right hand,\nwarm and soft during our handshake, looked like rhino hide on the back: dry and gray, the notorious\nbruise spread out like an inkblot test…\n“Let’s sit for a couple of minutes,” he said. “I hate to waste a lot of time on this, but if you’re going to\nwrite a bad story about my health, I’m going to sue the ass off of New York Magazine. There will be a\ntime when you can write that story, maybe in two years, three years, five years — five years, no one is\ngoing to care, I guess. Go ahead and sit down.”…\n“These are two doctors,” Trump told me before I could ask a question. “And by the way, I don’t know\nthem, they’re not my best friends. They’re respected doctors that practice out of Walter Reed. And they\nhappen to be taking care of me for anything — but I don’t need any taking care of because I’m in\nperfect health. I do purposely every year or less a physical, because I think the American people should\nknow that the president is healthy so you don’t get a guy like the last one, who was the worst thing that\never happened to older people. Because I know people in their 90s that are 100 percent. Gary Player is\n90 years old. He shot 70 with me the other day.”…\nWhen I arrived at the Oval Office in December to talk to Donald Trump about his health, the president\nwas standing next to a couple of men clutching pieces of paper labeled TALKING POINTS.\nFor all his raging against those who question his invincibility, Trump has acknowledged that he will in\nfact cease to exist one day. At Mar-a-Lago last year, with televisions tuned to former president Jimmy\nCarter’s body lying in state at the U.S. Capitol, Trump surprised people in the room when he said,\naccording to a person familiar with his comments, “You know, within ten years that will be me.” (Leavitt\nsaid she doesn’t recall Trump making such a comment.)\nIn a “not morbid way,” he has, according to a senior White House official, been “thinking more about\nwhat he will be remembered for.” Even the “crazy ballroom” that’s being built on the site of the\ndemolished East Wing, this official said, “is about leaving a legacy here.” His desire to leave something\ntangible behind might also explain the “Arc de Trump” he wants to erect in Washington or the decision\nto slap his name on the Kennedy Center. “He doesn’t think of legacy in terms of policies enacted,” a\nRepublican operative with ties to the administration told me. “It’s buildings he can leave behind and\nprizes he can win” — the most coveted of which, the Nobel Peace Prize, he managed to finagle from\nVenezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado in January…\nAs Trump approaches 80, he has been “sharing anecdotes about his father,” according to another\nsenior White House official, and how it wasn’t until his old man retired that he truly started to act like the\nold man he actually was. In this way, Trump appears to believe that having the job of president of the\nUnited States is giving him life. “He had an expression that I always remember,” Trump told me in the\nOval Office. “ ‘To retire is to expire.’ ” (As Eric Trump told me, “You’ve seen a lot of people who smoke\ncigarettes until they are 95 years old and the day they give up smoking, all of a sudden it’s the end. I\ndon’t think my father could give up working.”)…\nOn December 2, Trump called a Cabinet meeting at the White House. The livestreamed event was over\ntwo hours long and featured the kind of outlandish obeisance we have grown accustomed to in his\nsecond administration. “Sir, you made it through hurricane season without a hurricane,” Secretary of\nHomeland Security Kristi Noem said. “You even kept the hurricanes away, so we appreciate that.” As\nhis lackeys gushed over his leadership, Trump’s eyelids grew heavier and heavier until finally he\nappeared to nod off multiple times.\nShortly after the meeting ended, Leavitt beckoned me into her West Wing office for an interview with\nWill Scharf, the White House staff secretary. He promptly told me I hadn’t seen what I thought I’d just\nseen. “He’s always awake, always alert, always knows what’s going on,” said Scharf, whose job\nrequires him to be in almost constant contact with the president. “His work pace is remarkable. My dad\nis a few years older than he is; my dad couldn’t do the job that the president does. I don’t think I could\ndo the job the president does.” He added, “It’s not dozing. Sometimes if he’s thinking about something\n— and I made that mistake at first too — he adopts a pose. He leans back or leans forward a little bit,\nand he either closes his eyes or looks down — because he often takes notes in his lap.”…\nIn the Oval Office, Trump offered a different defense for closing his eyes during the Cabinet meeting.\n“It’s boring as hell,” he said. “I’m going around a room, and I’ve got 28 guys — the last one was three\nand a half hours. I have to sit back and listen, and I move my hand so that people will know I’m\nlistening. I’m hearing every word, and I can’t wait to get out.”…\n“Can I just ask about the MRI?” I said.\n“Yes, please,” Trump said, leaning forward in his chair. “It was the worst fucking thing I ever did, and I\nblame them.” Trump pointed at Barbabella and Jones, who sat motionless beside me. “They wanted\nme to take it. And because I took it, people want to say, ‘Oh, there must be something wrong.’”\nTrump turned again to the doctors.\n“Can you explain why you asked me that?” he said, shaking his head. “Stupidest thing I’ve ever done.”\nJones shuffled the handful of papers in his lap, each one filled with blocks of typed text and\nhand-scrawled notes. “We asked him to do it because he had a scheduled trip at Walter Reed,” he said.\n“While he was there, I asked him if we could complete some additional physical things that we were\nplanning on doing annually. And he was like, ‘Okay. We will work it in for time schedules.’” It wasn’t\nactually an MRI. “We did a computerized tomography exam of his chest and his abdomen,” Jones said.\n“It’s MRI-like.”\n“And not for any reason,” Trump said, cutting in. “It’s because the machine was sitting there, I’m sitting\nright next to it.”\n“There was no evidence of narrowing of any blood vessels,” said Barbabella. “And no abnormalities of\nthe heart.”\n“The reason for the imaging, as routine as we stated, is that any patient his age could have things, and\nwe ruled them out,” said Jones. “The story should be about the fact that the results were, uh, perfect.\nThey did not demonstrate any problems.”\n“Excellent results,” Barbabella muttered, almost to himself. “They were excellent results.”\n“I love these two guys; they’re great,” Trump said. “But I don’t know them. They’re White House\ndoctors.”\nFor weeks, I’d been trying to get a handle on Trump’s health. I’d come away thinking he might be pretty\nhealthy for an almost octogenarian, if not quite the superhuman the president or his team would have\nme believe. But I’m not a doctor, nor do I spend a lot of time with Trump. Now I was in a room with\nactual doctors who actually treat the president and know him. Perhaps more than anyone else in this\ncountry, they would be in a position to know — yet their proximity to him could be part of the problem…\n“Who is healthier, Obama or President Trump?” I asked.\nTrump stared across the desk, making eye contact with Jones. Jones didn’t hesitate.\n“President Trump,” he said.\nTrump nodded. There was no sign of a smile, as if there could not have been any other answer to that\nquestion.\n“Write that,” he said, turning to me."}

Yet, still…\n\nIs the Arizona Cardinals close to hiring a new head coach? The search began with a long list of\ncandidates, and now it is down to the short list. Coaches have gone through a first interview, and a\nselect few have been invited to a second interview.\nYet, still no hire. But that should come this week.\nPerhaps, Cardinals owner Michael Bidwill just hasn’t found his guy yet. Whatever he wants specifically,\nthat certain someone hasn’t surfaced. Oftentimes, people have to settle for one thing or another, and\nthen make a choice with the options in full display.\nOne prospect that remains in the select few, is Jacksonville Jaguars DC Anthony Campanile. On\nThursday, the Cardinals will conduct a second interview with Campanile.\nWho is he? What are his qualifications?\nBeginnings\nLike most coaching prospects, Campanile was a high school athlete playing quarterback for Fair Lawn\nHigh School in Fair Lawn, New Jersey. To be more specific, in Bergen County, New Jersey, which is\nthe most populous county in the densest state in the union.\nHe is one of four brothers and is of Italian descent. Campanile will explain about his family’s Sunday\ndinners with traditional Italian food and often spending six hours at the table with family.\nHis love for these meals is well-documented, with reporters often asking him about his favorite Italian\ndishes.\nHis father, Mike, was a high school football coach. All four brothers are currently football coaches. At\ntimes, their coaching careers have intertwined, as in some years, with a couple of the brothers working\non the same staff together. They’ve also coached against one another here and there.\nCampanile’s brother, Nunzio, is the offensive coordinator at UConn. His other brother, Nicky, is the\nhead coach at DePaul Catholic (NJ) High School.\nThis family is famous in the State of New Jersey for coaching high school football. In the last 25 years,\n21 New Jersey state high school championships featured a team coached by either Mike, or one of his\nfour sons.\nPlaying under his father, Campanile was situated in the run-and-shoot offense and eventually earned\nAll-Bergen County honors. He went to Rutgers as a walk-on and was switched to linebacker for four\nseasons under head coach Greg Schiano.\nAfter college, Campanile, now age 43, was hired by Fair Lawn High School as a linebacker coach. He\nwas then hired by powerhouse Don Bosco Preparatory High School in nearby Ramsey, New Jersey as\ntheir DC. The school captured the 2011 and 2012 state championships. USA Today ranked the 2011\nsquad #1 in the nation.\nCoach Anthony Campanile Rutgers (Image: Bill Conji Getty Images)\nAfter six seasons, Campanile took a position at Rutgers as a defensive assistant. He became part of a\ndefense that ranked fourth in the nation in scoring defense (14.15 points allowed per game). Then he\nbecame the TE and WR coach for three years.\nRutgers was busy trying to find a role for Campanile in their recruiting department. In the meantime, he\nhad an opportunity to interview with a Power 5 school. He worked under Coach Greg Toal at Don\nBosco Prep, whose two sons played for Boston College. There was an opening for the DB coach at\nBoston College, and Campanile was hired after a great recommendation.\nAfter being hired, he told NJ.com:\n“I am really excited to be a part of the Boston College community. I grew up in the Northeast, I received\na Jesuit education, and my Catholic faith has always been very important so working at Boston College\nhas always been a career aspiration for me. I am thrilled to be on Coach (Steve) Addazio’s staff with\nhigh-character men, and we are coaching tough kids where integrity is important. Those are the pillars\nof what I believe about football, and they all reside at BC. I know what it means to be a part of this team\nand this community.”\nBoston College assistant coach - defensive backs Anthony Campanile Icon Sportswire via Getty\nImages\nAfter two seasons, he was promoted and added the title of co-defensive coordinator, as well as\ncoaching the defensive backs. In his final year, Boston College ranked #29 in defensive efficiency. His\ndefense tied for the ACC lead with 18 interceptions. Campanile was voted “National Defensive Backs\nCoach of the Year” honors from 247Sports.com and FootballScoop.com, a national coaching site.\nCampanile was hired as a defensive assistant coach with the University of Michigan on Jan. 11, 2019.\nAt the time, he had six years of high school coaching experience at an elite level, plus seven seasons\ncoaching at Rutgers and Boston College. He spent a single season at Michigan. He was known as an\nelite recruiter, specifically in New Jersey.\nOnto the NFL\nAfter the 2019 season, Campanile was a top topic regarding coaching positions. He was rumored to be\nthe next head coach at Boston College. Then, the news was that he would become the DC at either\nRutgers or at BC. Finally, the media reported that he had been offered a promotion at Michigan to\nretain him and would be their LB coach.\nInstead, Miami Dolphins head coach Brian Flores reached out to Campanile and offered him his\nsquad’s LB coaching position. Flores is a Boston College alum and was familiar with Campanile’s\nprofile and strengths. Flores was revamping Miami’s coaching staff, and Campanile was his second\ncollege coach hire.\nCampanile was the LB coach for the Dolphins for four seasons.\nJeff Hafley had coached with Campanile at Rutgers and then was the head coach at Boston College. In\n2024, the Green Bay Packers hired him as their DC. Hafley then hired Campanile as their linebackers\ncoach and running game coordinator. The Packers ranked seventh in the NFL in run defense at 99.35\nyards per game and third in the NFL at 4.0 yards per attempt allowed. They also ranked sixth in the\nNFL in points allowed (19.9) and fifth in yards allowed (314.5).\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars had fired head coach Doug Pederson and hired Liam Coen as their new head\nman, who had been the OC with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He was filling out his coaching roster and\ncontacted Campanile about the vacant DC position. Campanile was interviewed and hired on January\n30, 2025.\nJax bound\nThe season before Campanile arrived, Jacksonville had one of the worst defenses in the NFL ranking\n#31 in yards per game allowed (389.9) and #27 in points allowed per game (25.6).\nIn just one season, the Jaguars were ranked the #11 defense overall and #1 in run defense.\n2025 Jaguars defensive rankings:\nPassing\nFewest total yards: #19 (3,933)\nMost completions: #29 (396)\nLowest yards per completion: #3 (6.2)\nPassing TDs: #14 (25)\nMost interceptions: #2 (22)\nFirst down conversions: #22 (197)\nMost sacks: #27 (32)\nRushing\nFewest total yards: #1 (1,455)\nFewest attempts: #1 (369)\nLowest yards per carry average: #2 (3.9)\nFewest TDs: #8 (13)\nFewest first down conversions: #3 (85)\nFewest runs of 20+: #2 (4)\nFewest runs of 40+: #1 (0)\nIn their first year under Campanile, the Jaguars jumped to eighth in points (19.8) and 11th in yards\n(303.6). Jacksonville allowed just 85.6 rushing yards per game. The Jaguars had the second-most\ntakeaways in the league.\nSeveral NFL clubs had Campanile on their head coaching search list. Some conducted interviews,\nalthough another candidate was hired.\nIs it a coincidence that Jacksonville won the AFC South Division title and earned a playoff berth with a\n13-4-0 record with a new head coach and a defense run by Campanile? He played a large part in their\none-year turnaround.\nCampanile’s scheme operates mostly out of zone and will blitz 25% of defensive snaps that are geared\ntowards creating pressure and hopefully will force turnovers. He uses a man-heavy approach, and his\nstrategy to date has been impressive.\nDefensive coordinator Anthony Campanile and Foyesade Oluokun #23 of the Jacksonville Jaguars\ncelebrate Getty Images\nTelevision viewers got an up-close taste of Campanile’s aggressive leadership methods on another\nEmmy award-winning HBO documentary series Hard Knocks that followed the 2023 Dolphins.\nAlthough he has interviewed for a head coaching position in the NFL and college, Campanile has never\nrun a team as the head man at any level. Campanile is a potential future NFL head coach.\nIs that now? He is a Rutgers alum, so he already looks good in a darker shade of red.\nAnthony and his wife, Tracey, have two daughters and a son."}

A Boomkat one-sheet for Dancin’ in the Streets, the\nDJ and producer’s latest release under the name Rat Heart, offers precious little clarity, just that he\nhails from Wigan, a town in the northwest of England. Until recently, the British online music retailer\nwas also the only place one could purchase the record. The likes of Cindy Lee, Alabaster dePlume, and\nStanding on the Corner have all delayed streaming’s instant gratification with their latest projects, but\nDancin’ in the Streets’ relative inaccessibility felt more like a protective measure. Most albums create\nrealms you can enter and exit with a tap; step inside this one, and…\n129 MB 320 ** FLAC\n…the door slams shut in your wake.\nIt’s dark in here. Dust coats every surface. Shattered blues riffs pockmark the open spaces in between.\nOn “NOT 2NITE,” an upright piano, electric guitar, and fluctuating dub pulses coalesce into a phantom\njazz trio. Boogizm works within forms that resemble traditional folk and blues idioms—there’s even a\nbarely adorned classical flamenco number—but in photo-negative. Dancin’ In The Streets is really a\ncollection of sounds around instruments: the sampled birdcalls on album opener “I H T”; ambient room\nnoise; notes so heavily reverbed that they continue travelling out past the point of audibility. Adam\nSinclaire’s concert flute offers intermittent companionship throughout the tracklist, a bit of the glimmer\nthat flecks “She Turns Down” off Cat Power’s Moon Pix. Few have approached that record’s oppressive\numbra since its release in 1998, and Boogizm can now claim to be among them.\nDancin’ In The Streets is profoundly immersive, but far from insular. The album’s guestlist, which\nincludes Sinclair, Switzerland-based singer Cansu Kandemir, and a mysterious figure who goes by\n“Tha Payne,” reads like the membership of a secret society. Boogizm himself is conversant with the\nwarped fringes of contemporary popular music: the Dijon-Mk.gee bitcrush-R&B; braintrust, for one, or\nDean Blunt, Joanne Robertson, and Elias Rønnenfelt’s extended universe of gothic neo-folk. Like a\ncampfire singalong played around the ashes, “(DON’T) SAY MY NAME” would nestle right into Blunt’s\nBlack Metal 2. “SELNE” sounds like a demo of a Jai Paul demo. The digitally paper-shredded “SHINE\nYOUR GRACE ON ME” and “OPERATION ALWAYS BE A BRAVE LITTLE CUNT” sound like natural\ncontinuations of BJ Burton’s work alongside Low and Bon Iver.\n“I feel things changing,” Boogizm croons on “I H T,” “Since you’ve been gone…living in hard times.” As\nhis voice—husky yet tender, usually stacked and pitched up or down—flits in and out of intelligibility,\nDancin’ In The Streets seems to chart a dark night of the soul. On “(DON’T) SAY MY NAME,” Boogizm\nplays a lonely demon begging not to be summoned. “REAL HARDCORE PLEASURE” brushes up\nclosest to the abyss, trapping us behind the eyes of a man trawling an escort website. Prose artist Ruby\nConner reads off a fractured litany of attributes and affirmations: “First-class girlfriend experience.\nOne-to-one. Discreet. Up for anything. Satisfaction guaranteed. I’m a lot of fun. Without emotion. Our\ntime together, anything you want and more, no complications. Your pleasure is my pleasure.”\nSalvation arrives, briefly, via the next track, “OPERATION ALWAYS BE A BRAVE LITTLE CUNT.” It’s\nthe closest Boogizm gets to something he could drop during one of his DJ sets, were it not for the\nneolithic drum machines that threaten to melt into pure feedback. You want it to go on forever. But\nthere is no absolution, and so Dancin’ In The Streets closes with “IGOTDRONESINMYBONES,” a\n10-minute flagellant march of industrial clangor and Gregorian synth pads. Sinclair’s flute returns as a\nwill-o’-the-wisp—some ephemeral light we might grasp at only to find it vanish in our hands.\nWith Dancin’ In The Streets, Boogizm joins the lineage of electronic musicians making exquisite\nsinger-songwriter records. “GREY SKIES, LIES + MEAT & POTATO PIES” and “TOWN, ARDWICK,\nTHEN LEVY; ON FOOT” flip their preceding songs into the sorts of grainy loops that would make for\nthe centerpiece of an Alchemist or Madlib beat. The album’s mixing—the electric guitar’s always a little\ntoo loud, the lyrics hard to parse without cranking up the volume—literally pushes listeners away, then\npulls us back in close. Obfuscation and hushed disclosure shade Dancin’ In The Streets, their contrast\nproviding a compelling throughline. Now based in Manchester, 20 miles from Wigan, Boogizm must be\nwell-suited to the city’s notorious pollution. He can breathe in smog, breathe out clean air. — Pitchfork\n« Duo Concertante – Alice Ping Yee Ho: Dark Tales (2025) Xan Tyler & Dusty Stray – Home (2025) »"}

And I don’t think I’ve ever seen myself reflected onscreen like that, in such a substantial\nway,” Kenworthy said. “The parallels are kind of insane. I also had a secret relationship, with these\nclandestine meetings and hookups.”\nHe went on to note: “And Miley Cyrus was my own Rose, this famous person that I was suddenly linked\nto, and as much as I kind of wanted it—because that’s the person you would want to be with if you’re\nstraight, someone successful and beautiful and talented—it’s not the same as when you’re with a guy.”\nBased on Rachel Reid’s “Game Changers” novels, “Heated Rivalry” captured the cultural zeitgeist\nshortly after it premiered on HBO Max and Canada’s Crave in November to critical acclaim. The\nsix-episode series follows professional hockey players Shane Hollander (played by Hudson Williams)\nand Ilya Rozanov (Connor Storrie), who meet as adversaries on the ice but are soon engaged in a\nsteamy, behind-the-scenes romance.\nOver time, Shane’s life in the public eye makes him feel ashamed of his sexuality, and he briefly calls\noff his relationship with Ilya to date a female actor, Rose Landry (Sophie Nélisse).\nIn interviews that predated his coming out, Olympian Gus Kenworthy described singer Miley Cyrus as\nhis dream celebrity \"Valentine.\" Daniele Venturelli via Getty Images\nKenworthy, now 34, came out as gay in a 2015 interview with ESPN. Three years later, he made waves\nat the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, when NBC broadcast footage of him sharing a\nkiss with his then-boyfriend, actor Matthew Wilkas, before a qualifying run.\nIn interviews that predated his coming out, however, Kenworthy described Cyrus as his dream celebrity\n“Valentine,” after which the pair followed one another on social media.\nThough much of the buzz surrounding “Heated Rivalry” has emphasized Williams’ and Storrie’s\ncharacters, Kenworthy said he “really related” to Scott Hunter (François Arnaud), who goes public with\nhis relationship with boyfriend Kip (Robbie G.K.) in one of the show’s most memorable scenes.\n“He wanted to be out, but really, just truly felt like he couldn’t be, because of his circumstances,” he\nsaid. “That was me for so many years. I had the same yearning—to be in love, to be public, and to not\nhave to hide.”\nIn recent years, Kenworthy has branched out into acting and reality television, appearing on “American\nHorror Story” and in Netflix’s “Coming Out Colton,” where he served as a mentor to former “Bachelor”\nstar Colton Underwood. Last week, he confirmed he’ll represent Great Britain at the 2026 Winter\nGames, which kick off Feb. 6 in Milan and Cortina, Italy.\nElsewhere in his New Yorker chat, Kenworthy said he’d auditioned for HBO Max’s “The White Lotus”\nbut didn’t land the part. Still, it sounds as if he’d be eager to join the cast of “Heated Rivalry,” which has\nbeen renewed for a second season, if the opportunity arose.\n“You know, I played hockey through high school,” he quipped. “I can skate, and I know how to handle a\nstick.”"}

The post Trump Hails Return of Final Israeli Hosta…\n\nPresident Donald Trump hailed the return of the final Israeli hostage’s remains from Gaza on Monday\nas an “impossible” outcome achieved — then declared it is time to pivot to Phase II of his Gaza\nframework: “Now we have to disarm Hamas.”\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) announced Monday that it had located, recovered, and identified the\nbody of Sgt. 1st Class Ran Gvili — the last Israeli hostage held in Gaza — closing out the hostage\nreturn track under the ceasefire deal’s first phase.\nTrump credited his team for the outcome in a Truth Social post, writing: “Just recovered the last\nHostage body in GAZA. Thus, got back ALL 20 of the living Hostages, and ALL of the Dead! AMAZING\nJOB! Most thought of it as an impossible thing to do. Congratulations to my great team of Champions!!!”\nIn interviews with Axios and Israeli television, Trump said Hamas aided efforts to recover Gvili’s\nremains, describing a grim search and identification process. “They worked very hard to get the body\nback,” Trump said, adding that teams “had to go through hundreds of bodies.”\nWith the final recovery completed, Trump stressed the agreement’s next step. “Now we need to disarm\nHamas, as they promised,” he said, arguing that skeptics were wrong before — and could be wrong\nagain now.\n“Nobody believed we would bring back all the hostages. It was a great moment,” Trump said, adding\nthat Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner briefed him Monday morning before he spoke with Prime Minister\nBenjamin Netanyahu, who Trump said “was thrilled.”\nTrump asked that his message be relayed to the family. “Please tell the parents that I am very happy,”\nhe said.\nAt the White House press briefing, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt called the return of the last\nremaining hostage’s body “a huge foreign policy feat,” saying the president “made the impossible\npossible,” while also pointing to the administration’s broader Gaza track tied to postwar rebuilding.\nIn Israel, Netanyahu called Gvili’s return “an extraordinary achievement,” saying it was an achievement\n“for the Israel Defense Forces, the State of Israel, the citizens of Israel,” and emphasizing the promise\nhe said Israel kept: “We promised, and I promised, to bring everyone back, and we brought everyone\nback, down to the last one.”\nNetanyahu later addressed the Knesset and recited the Shehecheyanu — a Jewish blessing of\ngratitude traditionally said upon reaching a significant moment — before announcing that there are “no\nmore hostages in Gaza” and thanking Trump, Witkoff, and Kushner for their “great and important\nsupport.”\nHe also ceremonially removed the yellow hostage pin from his lapel, saying that “now that the mission\nis accomplished, it’s time to take it off,” while stressing the next phase “is not rehabilitation, but the\ndisarmament of Hamas and demilitarization of Gaza.”\nIsraeli Defense Minister Israel Katz likewise thanked Netanyahu for “leadership and determination,” and\nthanked Trump “for the assistance and friendship,” praising Israeli forces for bringing home “all the\nhostages until the last hostage.”\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog said the country had reached “the moment we have been waiting 843\ndays for,” describing the end of the hostage ordeal as a national turning point. Herzog said his\nresidence “finally removed the yellow chair” kept in solidarity with the captives, and noted it was\n“particularly symbolic” to mark the moment alongside U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee as\nthey thanked Trump for “exceptional leadership and commitment to bringing home every last hostage.”\nThe completion of Phase I now places maximum pressure on the deal’s Phase II centerpiece: Hamas’s\ndisarmament.\nThat sequencing mirrors the administration’s wider Gaza framework unveiled last week in Davos,\nwhere Trump launched the newly formed Board of Peace and described it as a body that could be “one\nof the most consequential” ever created, with Gaza named as a central focus after Hamas agreed to\nthe broader U.S.-backed plan.\nAt Davos, Kushner outlined a “New Gaza” rebuild vision aimed at transforming the territory into an\neconomic hub by 2035 — a plan he repeatedly tied to verified demilitarization, arguing reconstruction\ncannot begin without security and that the framework is singular and fixed.\nTrump reinforced that same condition in his Davos warning, saying Hamas has agreed to give up its\nweapons and, “If they don’t do it, they’ll be blown away very quickly” — language he echoed again\nMonday after Gvili’s return, insisting the next move is disarmament.\nKushner, in separate remarks cited Monday, framed the recovery as both a conclusion and a pivot,\npraising coordination among the U.S., Israel, and regional actors and arguing that helping Gaza begin\n“a new chapter free from the tyranny of Hamas” is essential to preventing future bloodshed. “This is an\nend, but also a new beginning,” he said.\nIsraeli- and U.S.-backed officials meanwhile described the hostage track as fully resolved — “the table\nis clean,” as one Board of Peace official put it — while warning that the “strategic obstacle to everything\nis disarmament,” with parallel tracks now moving at once: border arrangements, temporary solutions,\nlong-term rebuilding, and a technocratic administration expected to assume civil governance inside\nGaza.\nWith Gvili finally home, Trump’s message on Monday was that the hostage chapter is closed — and the\ndisarmament test is next."}

I tried TCL’s RayNeo X3 Pro AI+AR\nsmartglasses, checked out Lucyd’s camera-free glasses, and played games with the ROG Xreal R1.\nHowever, there were two glasses that pretty much did the same things, but I thought one provided\nmore usability than the other.\nDuring the convention, I played around with the Xreal 1S and the RayNeo Air 4 Pro. The purpose of\nboth of these glasses isn’t AI, but instead, the glasses are used for entertainment, such as watching\nYouTube videos, playing games on your Nintendo Switch or anything else you can plug into a USB-C\nport.\nWhile both glasses do essentially the same thing, they have some major differences, and while\nspec-wise the Air 4 Pro should be the right option, these differences are glaring and tainted my\nexperience with TCL’s AR glasses option.\nIt’s worth noting that I didn’t have long periods with either of the glasses, just enough time to make\nsome impressions.\nThe RayNeo Air 4 Pro feel good when you’re wearing them, and at 76g, they’re pretty light on the nose,\nwhich would be good for watching content for a while. And while I was in a pretty loud room for the TCL\ndemo, I was still able to hear the content thanks to the Bang & Olufsen four-speaker setup. I would still\nneed to be in a much quieter room to really test out its audio capabilities, though.\nThe RayNeo Air 4 Pro also offers HDR10 for better contrast and up to 1,200 nits of brightness. On\npaper, it’s perfect, but it has some glaring issues for me. For one, the glasses have a 201-inch virtual\ndisplay at 6m distance, but you can’t adjust the size or distance. The glasses use a fixed optical design,\nand the screen is locked, though you can adjust the nose pads or use some spatial apps, like the\nRayNeo XR app on Android.\nHowever, the fact that it can’t do it natively is pretty frustrating. The Xreal 1s (and all the ‘Xreal One’\ndevices before it), on the other hand, has no problem doing this, changing the distance or the size of\nthe virtual screen. You can have the virtual screen anywhere from one to 10 meters and the size from\n31 to 500 inches. While the peak brightness of 700 nits isn’t as bright as the RayNeo Air 4 Pro, the\nviewing experience was still optimal even on the CES show floor. I could also hear content, but it wasn’t\ntoo loud. I think being able to change the distance and size of the virtual screen is optimal and allows\nfor any viewing experience. You can even give yourself an ultrawide virtual screen.\nAnother bonus to the Xreal 1s over the RayNeo Air 4 Pro is electrochromic dimming, allowing you to\ndim the background so that you have a movie theatre experience. This is one of the reasons why the\nRayNeo Air 4 Pro needs the higher brightness. Still lacking that movie theatre experience is a big miss\nfor the RayNeo Air 4 Pro, and I noticed that immediately when I put on the glasses. I definitely wanted\nto black out the rest of the room in the demo, so I could focus on the content, but that wasn’t possible.\nBoth glasses offer AI 3D video conversion, though I didn’t try it out on the RayNeo Air 4 Pro or the Xreal\n1S. However, I previously tested that feature on the Xreal One Pro, which uses the same X1 spatial\ncomputing chip as the Xreal 1S. It’s a cool feature and makes gaming a lot more immersive, and it’s a\npoint for the glasses, assuming it looks similar on both. The two devices also have a 120Hz refresh\nrate, though when you turn on HDR10 on the RayNeo, your display is locked to 60Hz.\nThe RayNeo Air 4 Pro is a great device that offers 1920 x 1080p resolution, HDR10, and peak\nbrightness of 1,200. But the Xreal 1s has 1920 x 1200p resolution, peak brightness of 700 nits, but\noffers electrochromic dimming to dim your background and spatial features, so you can control the size\nand distance of your display and choose whether it’s anchored to a spot or follows when you move your\nhead.\nThe RayNeo Air 4 Pro is US$299 (C$413), definitely more affordable than the Xreal 1S, which costs\nUS$499 (C$690). However, if I were deciding which to purchase, I’d wait a month or two and save the\nextra US$150 (C$216) for the Xreal 1S."}

The fine print along the\nbottom of an invitation to the premiere reads: “If you are a government employee or a government\nofficial, by accepting this invitation you are confirming that you have received approval from your ethics\nofficer or legal department to attend this event and accept any provided items.”\nThe boilerplate language refers to the fact that federal officials and government employees are subject\nto strict rules on accepting gifts from anyone who does business with the government to avoid conflicts\nof interest — or even the mere appearance of a conflict.\nThe irony is thick: A little over a year ago, Melania sparked a bidding war among Hollywood studios\neager to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration. Amazon MGM Studios ended up beating\nout both Disney (which had just donated $15 million to Trump’s future presidential library to settle a\ndubious defamation claim the soon-to-be president had levied against its subsidiary ABC) and\nParamount, which was seeking good relations with the White House ahead of a blockbuster merger\nthat would be subject to FCC approval.\nA few weeks before Amazon MGM Studios offered an eye-watering $40 million for the film rights — the\nmost the streamer had ever paid for any piece of content — Amazon founder Jeff Bezos dined with\nPresident Donald Trump and his wife at Mar-a-Lago. Editor’s picks\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, the first lady kept roughly 70 percent of the licensing fee, $28\nmillion, herself. And, technically, there is nothing illegal about that. “The first lady is, for ethical\npurposes, considered to be a private citizen, and so the conflicts-of-interest statutes, the regulations for\nother executive branch employees, simply don’t apply,” says Don Fox, the former acting director of the\nU.S. Office of Government Ethics, who worked under Presidents George Bush and Barack Obama.\nBut, Fox adds, his office would have advised against accepting such a lucrative deal with Amazon at\nthe start of a new administration because of the extensive business Bezos had before the federal\ngovernment: “It just looks like it’s buying access and buying favor.” Amazon Web Services is a giant\nfederal contractor supporting numerous government agencies, including the Department of Defense,\nand Bezos’ aerospace company, Blue Origin, has NASA contracts worth billions of dollars.\nA spokesperson for Amazon MGM Studios denied that the studio had any ulterior motives, telling\nRolling Stone: “We licensed the film for one reason and one reason only — because we think\ncustomers are going to love it.”\nAmazon’s purchase of Melania set off a frantic scramble to get as much footage as possible of the first\nlady in the weeks leading up to the inauguration. It was a chaotic process that involved hiring and\ncoordinating three separate production crews working in Florida, Washington, D.C., and New York City.\nEach had its own heavyweight cinematographer: Jeff Cronenweth, best known for his collaborations\nwith David Fincher; Michael Mann’s go-to cameraman Dante Spinotti; and Barry Peterson,\ncinematographer most recently of the infamous Colleen Hoover adaptation It Ends With Us. Each shot\nportions of the film. Related Content\n“People were worked really hard. Really long hours, highly disorganized, very chaotic,” one person who\nworked on the set said. “It wasn’t easy money,” another added. “It was very difficult because of the\nchaos that was around everything.… Usually [for a documentary] it’s like, ‘Oh, follow the subject.’ Well,\nit’s Melania Trump. With the first lady and Secret Service, you can’t just do things you usually do.”\nA full-time travel coordinator was brought on to deal with logistics issues that would invariably arise\nwhen, for example, members of the crew would board the Trump Organization’s Boeing 757 to film the\nfirst lady on a flight en route to Mar-a-Lago and end up without a ride home.\nOne person familiar with the production estimated that some two-thirds of the crew members who\nworked on the film in New York had requested not to have their names formally credited on the\ndocumentary. A separate person who will be credited on the film said that, after experiencing the first\nyear of Trump’s second term, they now wish they had not put their name on it. “I’m much more alarmed\nnow than I was a year ago,” that person said.\nPeople who worked on the film said they had fewer problems working with Melania Trump herself, who\nwas described as friendly and very engaged in the process, than they did with the director, Brett\nRatner. (“She was totally nice,” one person said. “She was the opposite of Brett Ratner.”)\nMelania is the first movie Ratner — who is known for directing the Rush Hour movies and X-Men: The\nLast Stand — has made since he was publicly accused of sexual harassment and assault by six\nwomen in 2017.\nActress Natasha Henstridge told the Los Angeles Times Ratner forced her to perform oral sex on him\nwhen she was 19, while Olivia Munn recalled Ratner masturbating in front of her when she visited the\nset of one of his films as a young aspiring actress. Ratner denied the accusations and was never\ncharged. More recently, a photograph of a shirtless Ratner with model scout and Epstein associate\nJean-Luc Brunel appeared in the newly unclassified Epstein files. (On the day the Los Angeles Times’\ninvestigation into Ratner was published, Epstein sent an email to his personal lawyer that reads “brett\nratner now. Oy.”) Through an intermediary, Ratner denied ever meeting Epstein to Rolling Stone.\n“I feel a little bit uncomfortable with the propaganda element of this,” one member of the production\nteam said. “But Brett Ratner was the worst part of working on this project.” That person said they\nweren’t aware of Ratner’s involvement until just days before filming began, and they would not have\naccepted the job if they’d known.\nAnother confirmed: “There was more talk about Brett being slimy than there was about Melania.”\nRatner left a trail of detritus — discarded orange peels, gum wrappers — wherever he went on set. “He\ndid actually chew a piece of gum and throw it in a coffee cup on my cart,” one person said, [but] “didn’t\nacknowledge my existence for even one nanosecond.”\nAnother recalled a long day during which the crew wasn’t allowed to break for meals, and no outside\nfood was allowed to be brought into the space where filming was taking place. “Brett, unknowingly or\nmaliciously, got his own food, went up there, was just eating it and just licking his fingers in grubbiest\nway possible, either being a dick or [having] no awareness whatsoever to the fact that everybody else\nis working and no one’s eating,” one person recalled.\nA third person involved in the production defended Ratner and praised his contributions. “He’s an\nintuitive, incredible, emotional, intelligent director, and you will see that on the screen,” this person said.\n“It’s not just a documentary, it’s a film — he’s a filmmaker that can go long shots, big shots. He sees\neverything from a different point of view [than a documentarian].”\nIt’s not clear how Trump and Ratner initially connected, but the director has become close with the\npresident and his wife: He is reportedly living in a villa at Mar-a-Lago and is said to have continued to\nfilm the first lady after production of the documentary concluded.\nA review of his political contributions indicates Ratner never donated to any of Trump’s three\npresidential campaigns. (To the contrary, records show multiple contributions to Hillary Clinton during\nthe 2016 race as well as gifts to Kamala Harris when she was still a California senator.)\nDespite the unfettered access to the first lady — described as extraordinary by people involved — and\nthe exorbitant sums of money that went into the film, viewers shouldn’t expect huge revelations about\nTrump’s wife, who has largely remained a cipher even after decades in the spotlight. “Some people are\nboring,” one crew member said. “Some people also never let their guard down.”\nAmazon has declined to share the film with press ahead of its release on Friday. But, having spent $40\nmillion to acquire the rights to the movie, the streamer is reportedly now spending an additional $35\nmillion to promote it, according to Puck News, with a campaign that includes TV spots airing during NFL\nbroadcasts and a takeover of the Las Vegas Sphere. Whether or not the studio’s investment will pay off\nin ways other than goodwill from the Trump administration remains to be seen.

But there are a few recent examples of films that cater to conservative audiences outperforming\nexpectations: Dennis Quaid’s presidential biopic, Reagan, was panned by critics but took in $30 million\nin 2024, and the similarly pilloried Daily Wire-produced film Am I Racist? brought in $12 million, making\nit the highest-grossing documentary that year.\n“Unfortunately, if it does flop,” one member of the Melania production team said, “I would really feel\ngreat about it.”"}

The first episode of the new year will bring back fan favorite Shantel VanSanten as Agent Nina\nChase, and the reason for the FBI: Most Wanted vet's arrival could lead to updates on that show's task\nforce.\nThe cancellation of FBI: Most Wanted was one of the most shocking of spring 2025, and the upcoming\nwinter premiere of FBI will provide the first on-screen check-in on one of the characters since their\nseries finale. Called \"Confetti,\" here's what to expect:\nWhen an undercover operation being led by Special Agent Nina Chase (guest star Shantel VanSanten)\ngoes sideways, the team works together to flip their only witness to help them hunt down a rip crew at a\ncartel wedding. The aftermath leads Nina and Scola to realize they are ready to tie the knot.\nScola and Nina were content with their cohabitation and co-parenting for a long time, but the events of\n\"Confetti\" will evidently have wedding bells ringing for the agents. Assuming everything goes well, it'll\nbe nice to see one of the agents get a romantic win after OA's relationship with Gemma fell apart in the\nfirst half of Season 8.\nScola has mentioned Nina from time to time in the eighth season, but \"Confetti\" will be the first time she\nappears in the franchise in a meaningful role since FBI: Most Wanted's cancellation. It certainly feels\nvery in-character for this pair that a cartel wedding is what makes them realize they're ready to tie knot\nafter all this time!\nFBI is generally quite procedural, but Nina returning for a case and (presumably) a wedding could\nmean the midseason premiere taking the time for some personal updates, which could mean news\nabout what the rest of her former team has been up to since last year.\nUnlike the similarly cancelled FBI: International, Most Wanted actually ended on a strong note with\nclosure for its characters, but that doesn't mean an update on their lives circa 2026 wouldn't be\nwelcome.\n(Image credit: Mark Schafer/CBS)\nWhen the final credits rolled on the original FBI spinoff, Remy was leaving his job at the Bureau, Hana\nwas repairing her relationship with Ethan, Ray was expecting a baby, Barnes was promoted to the task\nforce leader to take Remy's place, and Nina was credited for her terrifying driving skills.\nCINEMABLEND NEWSLETTER Your Daily Blend of Entertainment News Contact me with news and\noffers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\nSince Nina's ties to FBI meant that she was the most likely to return to the franchise, it didn't sting too\nmuch that Most Wanted ended without as major of developments for her as for Barnes and Ray. Now\nthat she is coming back, I'd love for Nina to at least mention what some of them are up to even if the\ntask force doesn't come out in droves to attend her wedding. Surely fans of FBI: Most Wanted at least\ndeserve to know how Ray and Cora are doing as parents to an infant, right?\nWell, we can find out before the end of February. FBI returns to start the second half of Season 8 on\nMonday, February 23 at 9 p.m. ET. Not only will Shantel VanSanten's return make it feel like a return to\nthe wider FBI franchise world, but the long-awaited premiere of CIA at 10 p.m. ET will expand the Wolf\nEntertainment franchise on CBS."}

It’s\nbeing directed by Benedict Andrews, who drew extraordinary performances from Gillian Anderson, Ben\nFoster and Vanessa Kirby in a celebrated 2014 Old Vic revival of Tennessee Williams’s A Streetcar\nNamed Desire.\nFor this new work, Andrews has forged Sophocles’ Electra with Ingmar Bergman’s 1966 gripping\nclassic, Persona, a film that starred Liv Ullmann and Bibi Andersson playing, respectively, a famous\ntheatre actress, inexplicably struck mute, who is cared for by a young nurse.\nWatch on Deadline\nAndrews says that the play will interrogate the inner life of an actress “and query how grief can make us\nstrangers to ourselves.” The production’s music has been composed by Oscar-winning composer\nHildur Guðnadóttir (Joker, Tár).\nBlanchett’s ramping up her stage appearances having led an acclaimed revival last spring of Chekhov’s\nThe Seagull, directed by Thomas Ostermeier at the Barbican Theatre. There’s much chatter about The\nSeagull heading to New York with Blanchett and the Barbican company in 2027.\nOh is making her National debut leading a new adaptation of Molière’s The Misanthrope from the pen\nof Martin Crimp. The production will be directed by NT artistic director Indhu Rubasingham and will play\nin the Lyttelton Theatre from June 16-August 1.\nSandra Oh National Theatre\nThe big deal about this particular Misanthrope is that it’s a gender reimagining with Molière’s infamous\nprotagonist, the misanthropic Alceste, now called Alice, a best-selling novelist who, as Crimp via\nMolière would have it, “despises the hollow contemporary mantras of kindness and respect. But the\nbolder she becomes in speaking out, the more colleagues avoid her ,and the more her personal\nrelationships begin to fracture.”\nOh, with her quicksilver wit, was born to play Alice. She’s such a great actress, and I can say that\nhaving watched every reel, practically, of her screen work including every episode she did of Killing Eve\nand every single episode she shot of Grey’s Anatomy for 10 seasons. Hers were memorable shows in\na way that the subsequent episodes have not been.\nRubasingham directed an earlier version of Crimp’s The Misanthrope over two decades ago at the\nChichester Festival Theatre. She tells Deadline that it’s “a real joy to come back to this play.”\nThe artistic chief adds that she’s “thrilled Sandra Oh, who I have known and admired for a long time, is\ncoming to join me at the National.”\nPerforming alongside Oh will be Paul Chahidi (The Night Manager Season 2) and Abigail Cruttenden\n(Ragdoll).\nIt’s also a big deal, in my book, that Toussaint, a much garlanded stage actress, will join Letitia Wright\n(Black Panther: Wakanda Forever) in the previously announced revival of Tracey Scott Wilson’s\nnewsroom thriller The Story, directed by NT associate artist Clint Dyer. Aliyah Odoffin (All My Sons),\nWilf Scolding (Andor) and Ashley Thomas (Hostage) also star.\nPerformances for The Story run from August 27-September 3 on the mighty Olivier stage.\nThe cast also includes Tee Arnold, Donna Augustin, Antonia Bernath (Downton Abbey), Linseigh\nGreen,Jay Simpson and Unique Spencer."}

This article explores how hustle\nhttps://punchng.com/what-ishowspeeds-visit-revealed-about-us/\n\nLast week’s tour of Lagos by American YouTuber and online streamer, known as IShowSpeed (born\nDarren Jason Watkins, Jnr), revealed many things about Nigeria. One key issue the visit exposed was\nhow we behave around money, around fame, around visitors, and around ourselves. It exposed the\nkind of country we want to be, and the kind of country we currently look like when the world is watching\nthrough a close camera lens.\nOne of the most talked-about issues from his visit was the “give me money” chorus from the notorious\nstreet urchins of Lagos Island, known as “area boys”. It angered some people, while it made some\npeople feel ashamed. But the incident revealed something many don’t want to accept: Nigeria has\nbecome a begging economy.\nIf IShowSpeed had not visited the Lagos Island part of Lagos State, perhaps that embarrassment would\nnot have been shown to the world. But this begging problem in Nigeria goes beyond the “area boys” of\nLagos. It is also not caused by poverty, as some people argue. Despite Nigeria’s recent economic\nchallenges, it is still far richer than most African countries. Yet, begging is more pronounced in Nigeria\nthan in any other country in Africa, because begging has been institutionalised through materialism and\nclassism.\nThis is not only about a person stretching out a hand on the road but about a mindset that has spread\ninto public spaces. People now see any public figure as a mobile ATM. If you are popular, you are\nexpected to “drop something.” If you are rich, you must “show love.” It doesn’t matter that the person\nhas no relationship with you. The public assumption is that money is meant to be shared, and if you\nrefuse, you are called wicked.\nPoverty is a factor, and we should not pretend otherwise. But poverty alone does not explain the\nboldness. Hustle culture also plays a role. Hustle culture teaches that anything that brings money is\nsmart, and anything that does not is foolish. It makes shame look outdated. It makes begging look like\nstrategy and opportunism look like “street wisdom”.\nThe danger is that this behaviour has been normalised. It is no longer treated as a last resort but a first\nmove. People do it in traffic, at events, online, everywhere. And the sad part is that many people do it\nwith a sense of entitlement, which makes it hard to correct.\nThe begging economy has also evolved to a newer, shinier version called clout. Clout is our new\ncurrency. It is another form of begging, but it wears designer clothes. It does not always ask for cash\ndirectly. It asks for visibility. It asks for a shoutout, a tag, a repost. It begs: “just help me blow”, and\nbecause attention now pays, clout is not cheap. Attention means followers and followers confer\ninfluence. Influence translates to brand deals, and brand deals can become a livelihood.\nThat is why even successful content creators chased IShowSpeed and didn’t mind being manhandled.\nThey needed a piece of the action. A selfie can turn into a profile picture. A short clip can turn into a\nviral post, which changes everything.\nThis is not unique to Nigeria, but Nigeria is currently a perfect home for it. In many parts of the world,\ninternet fame is now louder than political authority. Many young people can name ten influencers but\nstruggle to name five ministers. That shift is not necessarily a sign of ignorance. It is a sign that\ninfluence has moved from institutions to screens. People follow where entertainment, hope, glamour\nand money appear to be.\nThe problem is that we are chasing the fruit without planting the tree. We want the benefits of the\ninternet economy, but we are not building the systems that make it healthy. We want young people to\nearn online, but we are not investing enough in training and digital infrastructure. We want creators to\nthrive, but we don’t bother to protect intellectual property. We want to be a creative hub, but we treat\ncreativity like idleness until someone goes viral abroad.\nThis leads to another issue the visit exposed: hospitality without structure is chaos. Nigerians are warm\npeople. We treat visitors like royalty.\nWe can make you feel like family within one hour, which is rare to find in most other countries. That is\nour strength. But warmth is not the same as organisation. A country cannot run on vibes. A visitor\ncannot build trust on excitement alone. Tourism does not grow because people are friendly. Tourism\ngrows because visitors feel safe and guided.\nWhen foreigners want an organised West African experience, many think of Ghana, Senegal, Benin, or\nThe Gambia. Nigeria is the biggest country in the region, yet we are not the first name that comes to\nmind for a smooth tourist experience. That should worry us. It is not because Nigeria has nothing to\noffer. Nigeria has culture, food, music, history, art and energy. The issue is that the packaging is weak.\nThe systems are weak. The streets do not display order.\nAnd livestreams are unforgiving. The camera shows everything, including things we have become so\nused to that we no longer notice. Close camera shots reveal unclean and disorganised streets. Abuja is\ncloser to what a modern city looks like. It has its own issues, but it generally feels planned and clean.\nLagos is opportunity and disorder sharing the same bed. It is the city where people can become\nwealthy quickly, yet basic cleanliness and movement can still feel like a daily battle.\nLagos is not lacking in talent or money but in enforcement and planning. A city cannot be run by\nsurvival instincts alone. A city needs rules that are respected, consistent sanitation, crowd control that\nis proactive, and public behaviour standards that are taught early and reinforced publicly.\nWhen a foreign live streamer moves through a city, and the crowd becomes a storm, the world does not\ninterpret it as “passion”; it is interpreted as risk, danger or instability. That is how perception works.\nYet, even inside this chaos, the energy of Nigeria’s youth is something valuable. The crowd behaviour\nwas not just noise but raw energy without direction. Many of those young people were simply excited\npeople who wanted to be seen. Many wanted a story to tell, a chance to connect with a bigger world.\nThat energy is powerful. It can build industries and create jobs if well channelled and guided. Nigeria\nhas a youth population that is hungry for progress. The internet has become a new economy that they\nare tapping. Young Nigerians are learning skills on YouTube, building businesses on Instagram, selling\nservices on X, and earning from platforms that did not exist 15 years ago. Many are doing it with no\nsupport. Some are doing it despite the poor electricity supply. Some are doing it while data costs\nswallow their income. That is drive and resilience.\nThe question is what Nigeria can do to expand this space and make it less wild. We need practical\ndigital skills training. We need community hubs where young people can learn video editing, animation,\nwriting, design, coding, marketing and sales. Also important are better internet access and more\naffordable data. What about micro-grants and small funding pipelines that are transparent? We need a\nstronger culture of internships and apprenticeships in the creative and tech industries. Then, we need\nlaw enforcement that understands the digital economy, not one that treats anybody with a laptop as a\ncriminal.\nIf Nigeria wants to be taken seriously as a trusted destination and market, we have to start acting as if\nwe belong to that group. This must show in our conduct, environment, energy and leadership."}

But we should take a page\nout of his book and create the reality we want to live in.”\nWhen asked if she will be in the U.S. as Trump continues to lead, the Oscar nominee responded:\n“Probably not. I can’t work freely there. But I don’t want to give up completely. I’d like to make movies in\nEurope and then shove them down the throat of the American people.”\nMany celebrities have left the U.S. amid Trump’s second presidency, including Ellen DeGeneres and\nRosie O’Donnell. While Oscar-winning James Cameron originally moved to New Zealand to work on his\n“Avatar” film franchise, he recently made headlines for saying he will not likely return to America.\nPopular on Variety\n“After the pandemic hit… [New Zealand] had eliminated the virus completely,” Cameron said on a\nrecent episode of “In Depth with Graham Bensinger” podcast about his reason for getting out of the\nU.S. “They actually eliminated the virus twice. The third time when it showed up in a mutated form, it\nbroke through. But fortunately, they already had a 98% vaccination rate. This is why I love New\nZealand. People there are, for the most part, sane as opposed to the United States where you had a\n62% vaccination rate, and that’s going down – going the wrong direction.”\n“Where would you rather live?” Cameron continued. “A place that actually believes in science and is\nsane and where people can work together cohesively to a common goal, or a place where everybody’s\nat each other’s throats, extremely polarized, turning its back on science and basically would be in utter\ndisarray if another pandemic appears… I’m not there for scenery, I’m there for the sanity.”\nSpeaking to Variety earlier this year, O’Donnell said she currently has no plans to move back to the\nUnited States. She explained: “With the current political climate, when would it be safe to come back\nwith my child? I’m not going to push it before this administration is completely finished, and hopefully\nheld accountable for their crimes.”\nAs for Stewart, she has a history with Trump after he infamously tweeted about her personal life in\n2012. Trump encouraged Stewart’s then-boyfriend, Robert Pattinson, to dump her. Stewart reflected on\nTrump’s messages a few years later during an interview with Variety.\n“He was mad at me a couple years ago, really obsessed with me a couple years ago, which is fucking\ncrazy,” Stewart said at the time. “I can’t even understand it. I literally cannot even understand it. It’s\nsuch far-out concept that I don’t want to believe that actually is happening. It’s insane.”"}

However, that hype was seemingly misplaced, as, despite peaking at over 95,000\nconcurrent players little over an hour after launch, Highguard has already earned itself a \"Mostly\nNegative\" review rating on Steam. According to SteamDB , 78.2%, or 8,383 players left negative\nreviews on Steam, with only 2,333 of the 10,716 total reviews praising the game. So far, the studio\nbehind the game has not made any comments about initial performance or player sentiment, but it\nlooks like it might be another case similar to that of Splitgate: Arena Reloaded, which is now effectively\non life support , despite its predecessor's loyal player-base and a very recent launch.Most of the\ncriticism of the game seems to be centered around a lack of direction—the developers seemingly trying\ntoo hard to appeal to everyone instead of making a focused experience—poor map and interaction\ndesign, discordant pacing and mechanics, and lackluster performance. Some players also took issue\nwith the fact that it was essentially a 3v3 shooter with a sizeable map and tedious mining and looting\nthat don't seem to fit in with the game's stated goal of fast-paced gunplay. Many of these sentiments\nwere echoed by players on r/PS5 on Reddit, where players also expressed frustration about the game's\npoor image quality, or \"fuzziness\" and with what seems like a never-ending flood of MOBAs and\nshooters.\n#1 Auxityne\nI mean, it probably wasn't a good sign when \"we managed to keep this a secret\" most likely meant\n\"there was nothing about the game worth leaking\".

DHS later alleged in a statement that Pretti had “violently resisted” officers, despite\neyewitness video showing otherwise.\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller both\nbaselessly labeled Pretti a “domestic terrorist” and claimed he set out to kill law enforcement officers.\nJenkins kicked off his grilling of Blanche by citing reporting from his colleague, Bill Melugin — who\nposted on X that “half a dozen federal sources involved [in] immigration enforcement” have become\n“increasingly uneasy and frustrated” with the department’s messaging since the shooting.\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem at a press conference on Saturday, in which\nshe said Alex Pretti committed an act of “domestic terrorism.” Bloomberg via Getty Images\nJenkins quoted extensively from Melugin’s post, which said: “There is extreme internal frustration with\nDHS officials going on television and putting out statements to describe Alex Pretti as a domestic\nterrorist who was there to inflict maximum damage on federal agents or conduct a massacre, even after\nmultiple videos emerged, to show that these claims appeared to be inaccurate.”\nJenkins then cited a source of Melugin’s who reportedly said DHS’s response was a “case study on\nhow not to do crisis PR.”\nAfterward, the host asked Blanche a simple question: “Todd, I ask you, based on the DOJ’s purview, do\nthe actions of Alex Pretti amount to domestic terrorism?”\n“It’s an investigation, so I’m not going to prejudge what his actions were or were not,” Blanche said\nbefore launching into an attack on political leadership in Minnesota.\nBut Jenkins wasn’t having it and eventually cut Blanche off.\n“With all due respect, sir, my question is more pointed,” Jenkins interjected.\n“You are an attorney,” he said before citing the “legal definition of domestic terrorism” and adding that\n“it doesn’t appear to most of the country that have watched the available video ... it does not appear to\nhave met that definition of domestic terrorism. So, I’m just sort of wondering how you in the DOJ are\nviewing whether your colleagues may have gone too far?”\nA screenshot of Griff Jenkins grilling Todd Blanche on “Fox & Friends” Monday. Screenshot Fox News\nvia Snapstream\n“Look, I don’t think anybody thinks that they were comparing what happened on Saturday to the legal\ndefinition of domestic terrorism,” Blanche said.\nHe added, “What we saw was a very violent altercation. And I am not going to prejudge the facts.\nYou’re right, there’s a bunch of video that’s out there. There’s a bunch of video that we haven’t seen yet\nin the minutes leading up to what happened and what happened afterwards. And you’re right — to the\nextent there’s body cam or other videos that witnesses are still providing to us. So I’m not describing it\nas anything except for a tragedy.”\nHe then went on to bash Minneapolis and its leadership.\nWatch the full exchange below."}

Instead, you find yourself in a frustrating situation,\nespecially as a Mac user, discovering that the download button is nowhere to be found.\nThis isn’t a glitch; it’s a common roadblock that leaves your offline entertainment plans in limbo. This\nguide cuts through the confusion. We provide direct, tested solutions to download Netflix movies on a\nlaptop, whether you use Windows or a Mac. Every procedure described here has been verified through\nour hands-on testing on a Windows 11 PC and a MacBook Air running macOS Sonoma, ensuring you\nget a clear, actionable plan that works.\nHow to Download Netflix Movies on Mac\nWhy You Can’t Download Netflix Movies on a MacBook (But Can on Windows)\nIf you’re a MacBook user, you’ve likely experienced this specific frustration: you log into Netflix on your\nbrowser, look for the download icon, and find nothing. This isn’t an error; it’s a platform-specific\nlimitation. The ability to perform a Netflix laptop download using an official method is exclusively\navailable to Windows users through the dedicated Netflix app.\nSo, why is there no download option for macOS? The answer lies in Digital Rights Management (DRM).\nNetflix uses DRM technology to control how its licensed content is copied, shared, and viewed offline.\nThe official Netflix Windows app provides a secure, self-contained environment where these DRM\nprotocols can be strictly enforced. This allows Netflix to manage offline licenses, set expiration dates,\nand prevent unauthorized file sharing. A standard web browser on macOS does not offer this same\nlevel of integrated security, which is why Netflix restricts downloads of its DRM-protected Netflix videos\nto its dedicated Windows application.\nUnderstanding this technical distinction is the first step to finding a working solution. It clarifies why\nyou’ve been unable to find the button and sets the stage for the two methods available to you.\nChoosing Your Download Method: Official App vs. Dedicated Tool\nBefore you proceed, it’s important to select the right approach based on your computer and your needs.\nYour choice comes down to two primary methods: using the official Netflix app for Windows or\nemploying a dedicated third-party downloader tool. Each has distinct advantages and limitations.\nThe official app is the simplest and most direct technique for those with a compatible device. It’s free\nwith your subscription and fully sanctioned by Netflix. However, it is restricted to Windows, and all\ndownloads come with Netflix download limitations, such as expiration dates and device caps.\nA dedicated downloader is a specialized software tool designed to save Netflix content as standard\nvideo files (like MP4). Understandably, many people are wary of third-party software for services like\nNetflix. It’s crucial to choose one that is well-vetted, as this approach is the only reliable solution for\nMac users and is also ideal for Windows users who want permanent, non-expiring copies of movies\nand shows. While these tools are typically paid, a reputable one offers universal compatibility and\nremoves the restrictions of the official method.\nThis table breaks down the key differences:\nFeature Official Netflix for Windows App Dedicated Downloader Tool Platform Support Windows 10/11\nOnly Windows & macOS File Permanence Expiring Downloads Permanent, Non-Expiring Files File\nFormat Encrypted, In-App Only Standard MP4 or MKV Safety Risk None (Official) Low (with a vetted\ntool) Cost Free with Subscription Paid Software\nThe Universal Method: Download Any Netflix Movie on Windows & Mac\nFor Mac users without an official option, and for anyone who wants to create a permanent offline\nlibrary, a dedicated downloader is the most effective solution. After testing several popular tools—some\nof which were slow or failed on longer films—we recommend Keeprix Video Downloader for its\nreliability, straightforward interface, and broad compatibility.\nThis is a professional software tool designed to solve the primary frustrations of the official Netflix\ndownload system. Instead of being a simple screen recorder, Keeprix works by using a secure, built-in\nbrowser to access your Netflix account. It then directly downloads the video stream as it plays in the\nbackground, saving it as a high-quality, DRM-free video file on your computer.\nDuring my test, the tool downloaded a 90-minute film in about 15 minutes, and it didn’t just record the\nscreen; it downloaded the actual file in the background while I worked on other things. This technique\ndirectly addresses the most common pain points:\nMac Compatibility: Keeprix is fully compatible with both macOS and Windows, providing a universal\nsolution for any laptop user.\nKeeprix is fully compatible with both macOS and Windows, providing a universal solution for any laptop\nuser. Permanent Downloads: Because the tool saves videos as standard MP4 or MKV files, they are\nyours to keep forever. They never expire.\nBecause the tool saves videos as standard MP4 or MKV files, they are yours to keep forever. They\nnever expire. File Portability: Your downloads are saved as regular files that you can move to a USB\ndrive, store on an external hard drive, or play with any media player like VLC.\nThe process is simple: launch Keeprix, sign into Netflix within its interface, find the movie or show you\nwant, and choose your preferred download quality (up to 1080p), audio tracks, and subtitles. A heads\nup: the first time you log into Netflix through the app, it might trigger a ‘new device’ security warning\nfrom Netflix via email, but that’s normal behavior.\nChoose Netflix in Keeprix Video Downloader\nSign In to Your Netflix Account\nDownload Movies You Want on Netflix\nCustomize Download Setting\nDownloading Netflix Videos\nThe Official Method: Step-by-Step Guide for the Netflix Windows App\nIf you have a Windows 10 or Windows 11 laptop, using the official app is the most direct way to save\nmovies for Netflix offline viewing. This method is free with your subscription and operates within\nInstall the Netflix App. Open the Microsoft Store on your laptop, search for “Netflix,” and click “Get” or\n“Install” to download the official application. Sign In to Your Account. Open the app and sign in with\nyour Netflix email and password. Find Content to Download. Browse or search for the movie or show\nyou want to watch offline. Not all titles are available for download due to licensing agreements.\nAvailable titles will have a download icon (a downward-facing arrow) next to the description or episode\nlist. Set Quality and Start the Download. Before downloading, you can go to the app’s settings menu\nand find the “Downloads” section. Here you can set the video quality to “Standard” or “High.” A word of\ncaution from experience: setting the download quality to ‘High’ on my laptop with a small hard drive\nfilled it up after just three movies. Be mindful of your available space. Click the download icon on your\nchosen movie to begin. Access Your Downloads. To watch your saved videos, click the menu icon\n(three horizontal lines) in the top-left corner and select “My Downloads.” All your downloaded content\nwill be listed here, ready for viewing without an internet connection.\nUnderstanding the Rules: Official Netflix Download Limitations\nUsing the official download feature comes with a specific set of rules. Understanding these Netflix\ndownload limitations is essential for avoiding unpleasant surprises when you’re offline and ready to\nwatch.\nHow Long Do Netflix Downloads Last?\nThis is a common question, and the answer varies by title due to different licensing deals. Most\ndownloads expire after a set period, typically between 7 and 30 days.\nImportant: Once you begin watching a title, a second timer often starts, requiring you to finish it within\n48 hours. If a download expires, you will need an internet connection to renew its license. You can see\nthe expiration date for each title in the “My Downloads” section of the app.\nWhere Are Netflix Downloads Stored on PC?\nThe app saves them in a hidden, protected folder on your computer’s main drive. However, these are\nnot standard video files. They are encrypted data chunks that can only be read and played by the\nNetflix app itself. If you were to find the folder, you would see a collection of strangely named files, not a\nsingle movie file you could play.\nImportant: This is why you cannot move Netflix downloads to a USB drive or external hard disk for\nplayback on other devices like a smart TV. The files are locked to the specific app and device where\nthey were downloaded.\nDevice and Title Limits\nYour Netflix plan determines how many devices (1, 2, or 4) can hold downloaded titles at the same\ntime. Additionally, you are limited to a maximum of 100 downloaded titles on a single device at any\ngiven time. Once you reach this cap, you must delete existing downloads before you can save new\nones.\nFor a lasting solution, it’s important to note that reputable downloader tools like Keeprix are regularly\nupdated by their developers to maintain compatibility with Netflix platform changes and offer customer\nsupport, ensuring the method remains reliable over time.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nHere are concise answers to the most common questions about downloading Netflix content on a\nlaptop.\nCan you download Netflix movies on a laptop?\nYes. On a Windows 10 or 11 laptop, you can use the official Netflix app from the Microsoft Store. On a\nMacBook, there is no official app, so the only reliable method is to use a third-party downloader tool like\nKeeprix to save movies as standard video files.\nWhy can’t I download Netflix movies on my MacBook?\nNetflix has not developed an official application for macOS. The download feature is tied to its Windows\napp, which provides a secure environment for enforcing Digital Rights Management (DRM). Because\nweb browsers on a Mac don’t offer the same level of integrated content protection, Netflix does not\nsupport downloads on that platform.\nAre Netflix downloader tools safe?\nSafety varies greatly. It is critical to avoid free tools from untrustworthy websites, as they can contain\nmalware or be ineffective. A professional, paid tool from a reputable developer like Keeprix is a much\nsafer option. It processes all data locally on your machine, is supported by a dedicated team, and is\ndesigned specifically for this function without compromising your account security.\nHow do I download Netflix movies on a Windows laptop?\nFirst, install the “Netflix” app from the Microsoft Store. Once installed, sign in to your account, find a\nmovie or show with a download icon (a downward arrow), and click it. You can find all your downloaded\ncontent in the “My Downloads” section of the app menu.\nYour Solution for Unlimited Offline Viewing\nFacing a “download not supported” message right before a long trip is a significant obstacle. The core\nproblem is clear: the official Netflix download method is exclusive to Windows, leaving Mac users\nwithout a direct solution, while both user groups face limitations like expiring files and viewing\nrestrictions. A dedicated tool like Keeprix Video Downloader directly solves these issues, providing a\nuniversal method for both Windows and Mac users to create a permanent, flexible offline library. You\ncan finally regain control over your content. Instead of worrying about timers and compatibility, you can\nfocus on building your perfect travel entertainment list.\nExplore the tool’s features and consider a trial to see how it can solve your offline viewing needs in\nminutes.\nYou may also like to check out:\npage to keep yourself updated on all the latest from Microsoft, Google, Apple, and the Web."}

Her community has only just\ngotten the internet, and she spends her free time on MSN Messenger, chatting with friends and\nstrangers. While the internet opened an infinite number of doors for people to discover themselves, Sid\nis still searching.\nAfter she stares at pictures of beautiful women and masturbates to the thought of them, she still tries to\nhook up with and date boys. When she befriends the older girl she has a crush on (Beatrix Wolfe),\nshe's willing to be paired up with a boy just so that she can spend time with the girl.\nWhile trying to impress and become one of the older teens, Sid starts drinking, smoking weed, going to\nparties, dressing more revealingly, and flirting with boys. No matter what she tries, she still can't fit in.\nWhen her older sister's American friend Freya (Rain Spencer) starts paying attention to her, Sid thinks\nshe may have found her place. Freya is the first person to tell Sid she's cool—she holds the joint while\nSid takes her first hit of weed, she cuddles with Sid, and tells her she's gorgeous. She even does the\nclassic lesbian awakening move of getting up close to Sid's face and doing her makeup for the first\ntime.\nAt a party, when she thinks she's found safety by going into a room alone with Freya, Sid falls asleep\nonly to be awakened by the older girl having sex with a boy on the bed next to her.\nBig Girls Don't Cry isn't always an easy watch — it unflinchingly explores the pressure teen girls are\nunder to grow up and become sexualized for boys. While it never gets as dark as a movie like Thirteen\nor Kids, it certainly has scenes that some viewers may shy away from.\nGrowing pains are real, and in this movie, Sid experiences and causes all kinds of pain. She fights with\nher drunk, uncaring father (Noah Taylor), she feuds with her big sister when she brings home a friend\nfrom college, she abandons her best friend, and she even physically hurts herself, piercing her own\nbelly button in an effort to look more grown up. But in the end, she survives. And she'll have more\nsummers after this one.\nDebut actor Ani Palmer is stunning and carries a tremendous weight in the film. She's in every scene of\nthe movie, so there isn't a moment that doesn't hinge on her performance. Thankfully, Palmer and\nSchneideman's collaboration produced a performance that punches you in the gut and transports you\nimmediately back to your gangly teen self, making you cringe as if you're watching your own awkward\nmemories and drowning in the isolation of teen girlhood.\nIn another film I watched at this year's festival, the documentary Barbara Forever, legendary lesbian\nfilmmaker Barbara Hammer says that she didn't know the word \"lesbian\" when she first heard it at age\n30. While Barbara was discovering a whole new world of sexuality and possibility in the 70s, Sid faces\nsome of the same issues as a 14-year-old who had just gotten the internet in 2006.\nShe hasn't seen enough of the world to know that there are possibilities other than getting with boys\nand being like the other girls. Sid is so obsessed with being grown up, but she hasn't even gotten her\nperiod yet. Her summer is over, and so is this experiment, but her life is just beginning.\nSchneideman said that when her own small New Zealand town got its first cinema, Little Miss Sunshine\nwas the first movie she saw, and it opened her young eyes to the idea that there was a whole world out\nthere to explore. I'm sure there will be teens who see this movie and end up with a similar story.\nOut Review: 4 out of 5 stars."}

I’m grateful for the little peek into\ntheir world outside of home that I rarely see, like overhearing their teachers, especially in elementary\nschool, interact with such kindness and grace.\n“Good morning, my loves!”\nMy youngest’s teacher reminds her charges not to draw on the screen six times without raising her\nvoice.

We podded with our neighbors who had our toddler’s best friend, and would tag team watching\nthe kids play in the backyard while we took meetings and the big kid finished math homework at a\npicnic table.\nSomeone needed something almost every minute.\nToday, the fear that came with a global pandemic is gone, but the stress lingers. On this remote school\nsnow day, I remember what it was like to desperately crave self-care, privacy and, more specifically, for\neveryone to leave me alone in complete and utter peace.\nI’m working on a huge marketing presentation. My husband, who works in health care policy, is fighting\nthe good fight over the state budget. We’re snappy at the kids. I remind them it’s an exercise in\npatience for us all. I need the reminder as much as they do.\nI’m torn on snow days versus Zoom school. If they had a snow day, I could park them in front of the\ntelevision for a couple of hours and then head out to the snow on our timetable.\nIn fact, several parents logged in for the morning, then took the kids out to sled after lunch. If they have\ngood attendance records, does it really matter?\nIn our house, at least, Zoom school went OK for most of it. The girls were busy and stimulated and their\nday had some structure. They even got some work done, and given all the other days off this month\nand next, I’m glad.\nElementary school was smoother than middle school. My daughter’s eighth-grade homeroom teacher\ncalled out sick but didn’t tell the kids. The double drama class on Mondays was shortened to one and\nalgebra was pulled forward but we didn’t realize. I’ve now exchanged more emails with an assistant\nprincipal this morning than I have since September. At least our big kid is highly motivated and can\nnavigate Google Classroom on her own these days.\nWe’re also one of the luckier ones. Our kids have their own iPads, and I don’t have to give over my own\ndevice to one of them. In one of our parent group chats, someone mentioned that they borrowed a\nschool device, and it turns out it’s not working. So their child couldn’t even log on for any lessons.\nBut by 1:00 p.m., we gave up. The kids were fighting. The Zooms were done. We tried our best. The\nsledding hill beckoned.\nI don’t know how we did this for over a year.\nPlease send snacks. And a very good bottle of bourbon."}

At 66, Raimi reminds us who he was when he made horror-comedy history with “Evil Dead\nII,” and more importantly, why his voice still matters. A-” – Alison Foreman, Indiewire\n“A gripping, often brutal exploration of power, control, and inequality.

From July 30 to August 2, 2026, Pickathon will be celebrating its\n26th year of turning the lush hills around Happy Valley into one of the most diverse music destinations\nin the Pacific Northwest.\nBut fret not, fellow Pump House partiers, Pickathon just dropped their 2026 music lineup and it’s a\ngoodie! In what I’m coming to understand as their high-bar-setting curation of dazzling music from\naround the world, the festival continues their groove and dance-heavy tradition in 2026.\nAt first glance, the Pickathon 2026 lineup crown jewels include original bossa nova baddie Marcos\nValle, Portland’s Afrofuturists The Cosmic Tones Research Trio, Australia’s serene Folk Bitch Trio,\nfamous daughters The Womack Sisters, Sabbathian worshipers Acid King, the PDX post-punks Buddy\nWynkoop, and the electronic psych-cumbia of Terror/Cactus.\nIf you’re a bit turned off knowing only a small handful of the almost 50 band initial lineup, you’re not\nalone. Friends of mine had been trying to get me out to Pickathon for 13 years by the time I made the\nPendarvis pilgrimage in 2025, the shortcomings in my own music knowledge informing my decision to\ncontinually miss the festival I now plan on attending into perpetuity. Don't let the unknown frighten you!\nThat’s the beauty of Pickathon, you’re bound to discover several new lifetime favorites every year.\nMaybe it’ll be Jimetta Rose or Derya Y■ld■r■m, or maybe it’ll be Geese who played the festival in\n2024 and were the musical guest on Saturday Night Live last week. You truly never know what you’re\ngoing to discover at Pickathon. It’s an “I saw them at” festival of the highest order. If you see a band\nyou’re even remotely into on the Woods Stage or in the Barn, you’re gonna fall in love, guaranteed.\nOn first listen, beyond what I was already familiar with, there is, of course, heaps of good music coming\nto the farm this summer. LA-based bands The Altons and Thee Sinseers are playing together,\nslow-groovin’ with their updated doo-wop sounds; the outsider cumbia of the Bogotá-based Meridian\nBrothers; experimental noodling à la Mary Halvorson, Black girl magic hip-hopper who knows she’s the\nshit Sa-Roc; Jamaica born, Seattle-based original reggae head Clinton Fearon; Mexico City’s\nbeatmaker supreme Mexican Institute of Sound; Friendship sounding deeply like Jason Molina; the\nYemenese psych of El Khat (probably the most exciting artist I was unfamiliar with on the lineup); Dylan\nEarl’s politically sound outlaw country; and the PJ Harvey-esque intensity rollercoaster that is Prewn.\nWe’re well covered with the initial 2026 announcement, but if I may, it would be so incredibly excellent\nto get a bit more hip-hop and punk/hardcore music over the weekend. Portland do be going off with\nartists like Karma Rivera, Tasa D, Keeks, and Omari Jazz holding it down in the hip-hop realm.\nNonbinary Girlfriend, Boltcutter, Gossip, and Bijoux Cone would all crush their punk sets at Pickathon.\nGouge Away in the Barn? Satan’s Pilgrims on Cherry Hill? TOODY COLE OR URAL THOMAS ON\nTHE WOODS STAGE!? But I digress, Pickathon’s 2026 lineup is exceptionally expansive as is—but\nyou miss 100 percent of the shots you don’t take…\nAnd y’all, this is just an announcement feature. There will be more Pickathon coverage as we approach\nthe festivities. Look forward to Mercury writer Holly Hazelwood and I pulling together our must-sees of\nthe festival, as well as Hazelwood’s annual “Pickathon How-To” feature. And still to be announced? The\nDJ, food, literary, comedy, wellness, art, and kids programming are all still TBA. Stay tuned!\nPickathon takes place July 30 to August 2 at Pendarvis Farm in Happy Valley, Oregon.

The major label — which, alongside Sony Music and\nWarner Music, makes up the recording industry’s “Big Three” — has premiered a new streaming\nchannel dubbed Universal Music Live.\nAt launch, the content archive on Universal Music Live is pretty spare. A few clips from a podcast called\nThe Re:Fresh are available, but Universal is waiting until February 1 to kick off its live programming.\nThat’s the date of the Grammys, and UMG will celebrate by hosting an after-party red carpet stream,\nwhich it will broadcast on its new Twitch hub.\nUMG concocted its Twitch hub alongside in-house creative division °1824. Historically, the label has\nhad some frosty relations with major social media platforms, some of which have struggled to find their\nfooting in the music streaming biz.\nA UMG channel on Twitch provides a new opportunity for both parties. The label can build on the\npartnership with Twitch it announced back in 2022, following the lead of its Big Three brethren. Twitch,\nmeanwhile, can level up its music programming after launching a DJ category in 2024. That move\nbrought major label licenses to Twitch, and the Amazon-owned platform is now looking to make the\nmost out of those deals.\nThe result, in theory, will be a hub that appeals to the growing number of consumers who think of\nthemselves as superfans. UMG called out that die-hard group in a sizzle reel it uploaded onto the\nUniversal Music Live YouTube channel.\nFor those who harbor negative feelings about major labels, this move reads as an overly corporatized\nattempt to find more reach for pop musicians. Those skeptics, however, need to consider one more\nimportant detail: The Taylor Swift factor.\nT-Swizzle is a UMG artist, and her Swiftie fanbase is so powerful that major social platforms line up to\ncater to that cohort every time the singer-songwriter drops a new album. There are so many artists in\nthe UMG catalog that the Universal Music Live team would be remiss if it just focuses on one act. But\neven if Taylor Swift never shows up on the fresh account, the ubiquity of her fanbase explains why a\nchannel like this exists. Music fans are extremely passionate, and UMG just wants to reach them\nwherever they hang out."}

The Dragon Ball franchise has established itself as one of the most outstanding in the\nglobal entertainment industry, with much of the credit going to its iconic characters and intense battles.\nAs a series rooted in the sh■nen genre, Dragon Ball naturally incorporates many of the genre’s\nstrongest elements. While action and adventure form the core of the franchise, one of its finest\nstrengths is the rivalry between its two central figures, Goku and Vegeta.\nVideos by ComicBook.com\nIt is no overstatement to say that Goku and Vegeta’s rivalry is among the greatest in the entire\nentertainment medium, not just anime. The Dragon Ball franchise itself understands the importance of\nthis dynamic and has repeatedly revisited its clashes in one form or another. However, when all is said\nand done, Goku has consistently emerged on top. Beyond proving himself stronger on multiple\noccasions, Goku has also surpassed the Saiyan Prince in other aspects, most notably by being the first\nto attain new transformations. Now, Goku has also outdone Vegeta in terms of popularity, with the\nSaiyan Prince once again trailing closely behind Kakarot.\nGoku Defeats Vegeta in Dragon Ball’s Popularity Contest\nIn commemoration of the franchise entering its 40th year, Dragon Ball launched several projects, one of\nthe most notable being the worldwide popularity contest titled Dragon Ball The One. The popularity\ncontest began in November 2025 and featured a total of 212 characters. The final results, revealing the\ntop 20 most popular characters, were announced at a recent Dragon Ball event, confirming Goku as the\nfranchise’s most popular character, with Vegeta securing second place. While Goku claiming the top\nspot comes as no surprise, Vegeta once again finishing behind him highlights how this pattern has\nbecome a staple of the franchise.\nIt seems that no matter how much fans hope to see Vegeta surpass Goku at least once, the franchise\nmay never place him above Goku. This, however, is not something fans should be concerned about, as\nit aligns with the series’ overall design. That said, this does not mean Vegeta is inferior to Goku in any\nway. In fact, in certain aspects, Vegeta has proven himself to be stronger emotionally than Goku.\nDragon Ball Daima showcased Vegeta expressing more human emotions than Goku ever has, which is\nironic given that Goku was raised by humans while Vegeta was not, yet Vegeta appears more\nemotionally mature. Once again, this ties back to the series’ intended structure. However, it is important\nto note that with Vegeta also achieving Super Saiyan 3, it appears the franchise may be moving toward\ngiving him his due, and perhaps in the future, fans might finally see Vegeta defeat Goku at least once in\nthe Dragon Ball franchise.\nWhat do you think?

A year later, shortly after completing his Second Symphony, he sent his\nbrothers a stunning letter about the joy of suffering overcome, in which he resolved:\nAh! how could I possibly quit the world before bringing forth all that I felt it was my vocation to produce?\nThat year, he began — though he did not yet know it, as we never do — the long gestation of what\nwould become not only his greatest creative and spiritual triumph, not only a turning point in the history\nof music that revolutionized the symphony and planted the seed of the pop song, but an eternal\nmasterwork of the supreme human art: making meaning out of chaos, beauty out of sorrow.\nAcross the epochs, “Ode to Joy” rises vast and eternal, transcending all of spacetime and at the same\ntime compacting it into something so intimate, so immediate, that nothing seems to exist outside this\nsingularity of all-pervading possibility. Inside its total drama, a total tranquility; inside its revolt, an oasis\nof refuge. The story of its making is as vitalizing as the masterpiece itself — or, rather, its story is the\nvery reason for its vitality.\nAs a teenager, while auditing Kant’s lectures at the University of Bonn, Beethoven had fallen under the\nspell of transcendental idealism and the ideas of the Enlightenment — ideas permeating the poetry of\nFriedrich Schiller. A volume of it became the young Beethoven’s most cherished book and so began\nthe dream of setting it to music. (There is singular magic in a timeless poem set to music.)\nOne particular poem especially entranced him: Written when Beethoven was fifteen and the electric\nspirit of revolution saturated Europe’s atmosphere, Schiller’s “Ode to Joy” was at heart an ode to\nfreedom — a blazing manifesto for the Enlightenment ethos that if freedom, justice, and human\nhappiness are placed at the center of life and made its primary devotion, politically and personally, then\npeace and kindness would envelop humankind as an inevitable consequence. A “kiss for the whole\nworld,” Schiller had written, and the teenage Beethoven longed to be lips of the possible.\nThis Elysian dream ended not even a decade later as the Reign of Terror dropped the blade of the\nguillotine upon Marie Antoinette, then upon ten thousand other heads and the dreams they carried.\nSchiller died considering his “Ode to Joy” a failure — an idealist’s fantasy unmoored from reality, a work\nof art that might have been of service perhaps for him, perhaps for a handful of others, “but not for the\nworld.”\nThe young Beethoven was among those few it touched, and this was enough, more than enough — he\ntook Schiller’s bright beam of possibility and magnified it through the lens of his own genius to\nilluminate all of humanity for all of time. Epochs later, in the savage century of the World Wars and the\nHolocaust, Rebecca West — another uncommon visionary, who understood that “art is not a plaything,\nbut a necessity” — would contemplate how those rare few help the rest of humanity endure, observing\nthat “if during the next million generations there is but one human being born in every generation who\nwill not cease to inquire into the nature of his fate, even while it strips and bludgeons him, some day we\nshall read the riddle of our universe.”\nWhile Schiller’s poem was ripening in Beethoven’s imagination, the decade-long Napoleonic Wars\nstripped and bludgeoned Europe. When Napoleon’s armies invaded and occupied Vienna — where\nBeethoven had moved at twenty-one to study with his great musical hero, Haydn — most of the wealthy\nfled to the country. He took refuge with his brother, sister-in-law, and young nephew in the city.\nThirty-nine and almost entirely deaf, Beethoven found himself “suffering misery in a most concentrated\nform” — misery that “affected both body and soul” so profoundly that he produced “very little coherent\nwork.” From inside the vortex of uncertainty and suffering, he wrote:\nThe existence I had built up only a short time ago rests on shaky foundations. What a destructive,\ndisorderly life I see and hear around me: nothing but drums, cannons, and human misery in every form.\nThat spring, Haydn’s death only deepened his despair at life. The next six years were an unremitting\nheartache. His love went unreturned. He grew estranged from one of his brothers, who married a\nwoman Beethoven disliked. His other brother died. He entered an endless legal combat over\nguardianship of his young nephew. He spent a year bedridden with a mysterious illness he called “an\ninflammatory fever,” riddled with skull-splitting headaches. His hearing almost completely deteriorated.\nHe grew repulsed by the trendy mysticism of new musical developments, which made no room for the\nraw human emotion that was to him both the truest material and truest product of art.\nSomehow, he kept composing, the act itself becoming the fulcrum by which Beethoven lifted himself\nout of the black hole to perch on the event horizon of a new period of great creative fertility. While Blake\n— his twin in the tragic genius of outsiderdom — was painting the music of the heavens, Beethoven\nwas grounding a possible heaven onto a disillusioned earth with music.\nAnd then he ended up in jail.\nOne autumn day in 1822, the fifty-two-year-old composer put on his moth-eaten coat and set out for\nwhat he intended as a short morning walk in the city, his mind a tempest of ideas. Walking had always\nbeen his primary laboratory for creative problem-solving, so the morning stroll unspooled into a long\nhalf-conscious walk along the Danube. In a classic manifestation of the self-forgetting that marks the\nintense creative state now known as “flow,” Beethoven lost track of time, of distance, of the demands of\nhis own body.\nHe walked and walked, hatless and absorbed, not realizing how famished and fatigued he was growing,\nuntil the afternoon found him wandering disheveled and disoriented in a river basin far into the\ncountryside. There, he was arrested by local police for “behaving in a suspicious manner,” taken to jail\nas “a tramp” with no identity papers, and mocked for claiming that he was the great Beethoven — by\nthen a national icon, with a corpus of celebrated concertos and sonatas to his name, and eight whole\nsymphonies.\nThe tramp raged and raged, until eventually, close to midnight, the police dispatched a nervous officer\nto wake up a local musical director, who Beethoven demanded could identify him. Instant recognition.\nRighteous rage. Apologies. Immediate release. More rage. More apologies. Beethoven spent the night\nat his liberator’s house. In the morning, the town’s apologetic mayor collected him and drove him back\nto Vienna in the mayoral carriage.\nWhat had so distracted Beethoven from space and time and self was that, twenty-seven years after\nfalling under the spell of Schiller’s poem, he was at last ferocious with ideas for bringing it to life in\nmusic. He had been thinking about it incessantly for months. “Ode to Joy” would become the crowning\nachievement of his crowning achievement — the choral finale of his ninth and final symphony. It would\ndistill the transcendent torment of his creative life: how to integrate rage and redemption, the solace of\npoetry with the drama of music; how to channel his own poetic fury as a force of beauty, of vitality, of\nmeaning; how to turn the human darkness he had witnessed and suffered into something\nincandescent, something superhuman.\nIt had to be in a symphony, although he had not composed one in a decade and no composer — not\nBach, not Mozart, not his hero Haydn — had ever woven lyric poetry or any words at all into a\nsymphony before; the word “lyrics” was yet to enter the lexicon in its musical sense. It had to be the\ncrowning choral finale of the symphony, although he had not written much choral music before. But the\nlight of the idea beamed bright and irrefutable as spring. This was no time for old laurels, no time for\ncatering to proven populisms — this was the time for creation. A decade earlier, Beethoven had written\nback to a young girl aspiring to become a great pianist, offering his advice on the central urgency of the\ncreative calling:\nThe true artist is not proud… Though he may be admired by others, he is sad not to have reached that\npoint to which his better genius only appears as a distant, guiding sun.\nSo often, in advising others, we are advising ourselves — the most innocent, vulnerable, and visionary\nparts of us, those parts from which the spontaneity and daring central to creative work spring. I wonder\nwhether Beethoven remembered his own advice to Emilie as he faced the blank page that spring in\n1822 when the first radiant contours of his “Ode to Joy” filled his mind and his footfall.\nBy summer, he was actively seeking out commissions to live on as he labored. He managed to procure\na meager £50 from London’s Harmony Society, but that was enough subsistence and assurance to get\nto work. For more than a year, he labored unremittingly, stumbling over creative challenge after creative\nchallenge — the price of making anything unexampled. His greatest puzzle was how to introduce the\nwords into the final movement and how to choose the voices that would best carry them.\nMeanwhile, word was spreading in Vienna that its most beloved composer was working on something\nwildly ambitious — his first symphony in a decade, and no ordinary symphony. But just as theater\nmanagers began vying for the premiere, Beethoven stunned everyone with the announcement that it\nwas going to premiere in Berlin. He gave no reason. Viennese musicians took it as an affront — did he\nthink they were too traditional to appreciate something so bold? He had been born in Germany, yes, but\nhe had become himself in Austria. Surely, he owed the seedbed of his creative blossoming some\nmeasure of faith.\nAt the harsh peak of winter, Karoline Unger — the nineteen-year-old contralto Beethoven had already\nchosen to voice the deepest feeling-tones of his “Ode to Joy” — exhorted him to premiere his\nmasterwork in Vienna. Writing in his Conversation Books — the notebooks through which the deaf\ncomposer communicated with the hearing world — she told him he had “too little self-confidence” in the\nViennese public’s reception of his masterwork, urged him to go forward with the concert, then\nexclaimed: “O Obstinacy!”\nWithin a month, thirty of his most esteemed Austrian admirers — musicians and poets, composers and\nchamberlains — had co-written and signed an impassioned open letter to Beethoven, laced with\npatriotism and flattery, telling him that while his “name and creations belong to all contemporaneous\nhumanity and every country which opens a susceptible bosom to art,” it is his artistic duty to complete\nthe Austrian triad of Mozart and Haydn; imploring him not to entrust “the appreciation for the pure and\neternally beautiful” to unworthy “foreign power” and to establish instead “a new sovereignty of the True\nand the Beautiful” in Vienna. The letter was hand-delivered to him by a court secretary who tutored the\nroyal family.\nNot even the most stubborn and single-minded artist is impervious to the sway of adulation. “It’s very\nbeautiful, it makes me very happy!” The Viennese concert was on.\nBut Beethoven bent under the weight of his own expectations in a crippling combination of\nmicro-managing and indecision. Eager to control every littlest detail to perfection, he committed to one\ntheater, then changed his mind and committed to another, then it all became too much to bear — he\ncancelled the concert altogether.\nAfter a monthlong tailspin, the finitude of time — concert season was almost over — pinned him to the\nstill point of decision. He uncancelled the concert and, once again confounding everyone, signed with\none of the underbidding imperial court theaters he had at first rejected.\nThe date was set for early May. He hand-picked the four soloists who would anchor the choir and\nassembled an orchestra dwarfing all convention: two dozen violins, two dozen wind instruments, a\ndozen cellos and basses, ten violas, and all that percussion.\nIt was to be not only a performance, not only a premiere, but something more — the emblem of a\ncredo, musical and humanistic. The reception of the symphony would make or break the reception of\nthe ideals behind it. Against this backdrop, it is slightly less shocking — but only slightly — that, in an\nastonishing final bid for total control of his creation, Beethoven demanded that he conduct the\nsymphony himself.\nEveryone knew he was deaf. Now they feared he was demented.\nThe theater, having won the coveted premiere, reluctantly conceded, fearing Beethoven might change\nhis mind again if his demand went unmet, but persuaded him to have the original conductor onstage\nwith him, with every assurance that he would only be there for backup. The conductor, meanwhile,\ninstructed the choir and orchestra to follow only his motions and “pay no attention whatever to\nBeethoven’s beating of the time.” The best assurance even one of Beethoven’s closest friends — who\nlater became his biographer — could muster was that the theater would be too dim for anyone to notice\nthat Beethoven was conducting in his old green frock and not in the fashionable black coat a conductor\nwas supposed to wear.\nAfter two catastrophic rehearsals — the only two the enormous ensemble could manage in the brief\ntime before the performance — the soloists railed that their parts were simply impossible to sing.\nKaroline Unger called him a “tyrant over all the vocal organs.” One of the two male soloists quit\naltogether and had to be replaced by a member of the choir who had memorized the part.\nSomehow, the show went on.\nOn the early evening of May 7, 1824, the Viennese crowded into the concert hall — but they were not\nthe usual patrons. Looking up to the royal box, Beethoven was crushed to see it empty. He had\njourneyed to the palace to personally invite the Emperor and Empress but, like most of the aristocracy,\nthey had vanished into their country estate as soon as spring broke the harsh Austrian winter. He was\ngoing to be playing for the people. But it was the people, after all, that Schiller had yearned to vitalize\nwith his poem.\nBeethoven walked onto the grand stage, faced the orchestra, and raised his arms. Despite the natural\nimperfections of a performance built on such tensions, something shifted as soon as the music —\nexalted, sublime, total — rose above the individual lives and their individual strife, subsuming every\nbody and every soul in a single harmonious transcendence.\nAfter the final chord of “Ode to Joy” resounded, the gasping silence broke into a scream of applause.\nPeople leapt to their feet, waving their handkerchiefs and chanting his name. Beethoven, still facing the\norchestra and still waving his arms to the delayed internal time of music only he could hear, noticed\nnone of it, until Karoline Unger stood up, took his arm, and gently turned him around.\nWith the birth of photography still fifteen years of trial and triumph away, it is only in the mind’s eye that\none can picture the cascade of confusion, disbelief, and elation that must have washed over\nBeethoven’s face in that sublime moment when his guiding sun seemed suddenly so proximate, almost\nblinding with triumph.\nAs soon as he faced the audience, the entire human mass erupted with not one, not two, not three, but\nfour volcanic bursts of applause, until the Police Commissioner managed to yell “Silence!” over the fifth.\nThese were still revolutionary times, after all, and art that roused so fierce a response in the human\nsoul — even if that response was exultant joy — was dangerous art. Here, in the unassailable message\nof “Ode to Joy,” was a clarion call to humanity to discard all the false gods that had fueled a century of\nunremitting wars and millennia of inequality — the divisions of nation and rank, the oppressions of\ndogma and tradition — and band together in universal sympathy and solidarity.\nThe sound of Beethoven’s call resounded long after its creator was gone. Whitman celebrated it as the\nprofoundest expression of nature and human nature. Helen Keller “heard” it with her hand pressed\nagainst the radio speaker and suddenly understood the meaning of music. Chilean protesters sang it as\nthey took down the Pinochet dictatorship. Japanese musicians performed it after the T■hoku\nearthquake and tsunami. Chinese students blasted it in Tiananmen Square. Leonard Bernstein, patron\nsaint of music as an instrument of humanism, conducted a group of musicians who had lived on both\nsides of the Berlin Wall in a Christmas Day concert after its fall. Ukrainian composer Victoria Poleva\nreimagined it for an international concert commemorating the fiftieth anniversary. A decade later, the\nNational Symphony Orchestra of Ukraine performed her reimagining not long before a twenty-first\ncentury tyrant with a Napoleonic complex and a soul deaf to the music of life bludgeoned the small\ncountry with his lust for power.\nBut this, I suspect, was Beethoven’s stubborn, sacred point — the reason he never gave up on\nSchiller’s dream, even as he lived through nightmares: this unassailable insistence that although the\nNapoleons and Putins of the world will rise to power again and again over the centuries, they will also\nfall, because there is something in us more powerful as long as we continue placing freedom, justice,\nand universal happiness at the center of our commitment to life, even as we live through nightmares.\nTwo centuries after Beethoven, Zadie Smith affirmed this elemental reality in her own life-honed\nconviction that “progress is never permanent, will always be threatened, must be redoubled, restated\nand reimagined if it is to survive.”\nIn the winter of my thirteenth year, two centuries after Beethoven’s day and a few fragile years after the\nfall of Bulgaria’s communist dictatorship, I stood in the holiday-bedazzled National Symphony Hall\nalongside a dozen classmates from the Sofia Mathematics Gymnasium, our choir about to perform\nBeethoven’s “Ode to Joy,” recently adopted as the anthem of Europe by the European Union, of which\nthe newly liberated Bulgaria longed to be a part.\nWe sang the lyrics in Bulgarian, but “joy” has no direct translation. “Felicity” might come the closest, or\n“mirth” — those wing-clipped cousins of joy, bearing the same bright feeling-tone, but lacking its elation,\nits all-pervading exhale — a diminishment reflecting the spirit of a people just emerging from five\ncenturies of Ottoman occupation closely followed by a half-century Communist dictatorship.\nAnd yet we stood there in our best clothes, in the spring of life, singing together, our teenage minds\nabloom with quadratic equations and a lust for life, our teenage bodies reverberating with the\nredemptive dream of a visionary who had died epochs before any of our lives was but a glimmer in a\ngreat-great-grandparent’s eye, our teenage spirits longing to kiss the whole world with possibility.\nToday, “Ode to Joy” — a recording by the Berlin Philharmonic from the year I was born — streams into\nmy wireless headphones as I cross the Brooklyn Bridge on my bicycle, riding into a life undreamt in that\nteenage girl’s wildest dreams, into a world unimaginable to Beethoven, a world where suffering remains\nour constant companion but life is infinitely more possible for infinitely more people, and more kinds of\npeople, than even the farthest seer of 1822 could have envisioned.\nI ride into the spring night, singing. This, in the end, might be the truest translation of “joy” — this\necstatic fusion of presence and possibility."}

He is, however, someone who would be\nuseful if you needed an associate who could stealthily sneak around the Big Apple, as one Detective\nJane Porter (Callies) soon realizes.\nNarratively, then, \"Tarzan\" basically turns the Lord of the Jungle into Batman ... though, if you're a child\nof the 1990s, it may also sound like a live-action riff on Disney's \"Gargoyles\" that swaps out Keith\nDavid's Goliath for another stoic hunk.

(Jim Frohna/Sundance Institute via AP)\nPARK CITY, Utah -- PARK CITY, Utah (AP) — Jay Duplass had come to a turning point in his life and\ncareer. After years of mining personal stories, add those of his family, he’d decided that he was ready\nto tell other people’s stories.\nThat’s when Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon approached him with a special project that fit the bill,\nAdam Cayton-Holland’s tragicomic script, and memoir, about his PTSD after his sister dies by suicide.\nIt had Duplass both laughing and crying and wanting to help tell the story.\n“You really have to be like irrationally in love with the movie that you’re making,” Duplass said. “We’re\nreally standing on the shoulders of the Cayton-Holland family in Denver who got hit with something\nsurprising and unbelievable. It’s the story not only of how they survived it but came through better\npeople.”\nThe film, “See You When I See You,” is having its world premiere Tuesday at the Sundance Film\nFestival where it is seeking distribution. It stars Cooper Raiff, Kaitlyn Dever, David Duchovny, Hope\nDavis and Lucy Boynton.\n“I kind of see it an heir to their film ‘The Big Sick,’” Duplass said, of Nanjiani and Gordon's\nOscar-nominated romantic comedy.\nPutting Raiff in the lead role over a more established movie star was an unconventional choice, to say\nthe least, but Duplass was certain it was the right one. He’s been Raiff’s de facto mentor since before\nRaiff made his first feature. He saw in him a range that he hadn't quite observed in some of his peers.\n“He’s just so talented and smart and funny and emotionally available,” Duplass said. “Frankly there\naren’t a lot of 27-year-olds who are all those things.” (Raiff is now 28).\nRounding out the cast with more well-known names was then non-negotiable. But Duplass has noticed\nin the past 10 to 15 years that it’s harder to get big name actors to join smaller art movies. Part of that,\nhe said, is that actors are making “so much money in TV” and that the talent agencies are gatekeeping\ntheir talent on the off chance that a last minute offer will come in for one episode or a limited series.\nHe credits Dever, Duchovny, Davis and Boynton for being willing to commit to this film in spite of\neverything.\n“It’s not a lot of money,” Duplass said. “These people are people who want to make art and who really\nwere willing to take a chance and, you know, make something crazy with me.”\n___\nFor more coverage of the 2026 Sundance Film Festival, visit:\nhttps://apnews.com/hub/sundance-film-festival"}

The plaintiff, a 20-year-old woman\nidentified by the initials KGM, alleges the design of platforms' algorithms left her addicted to social\nmedia and negatively affected her mental health. \"The parties are pleased to have reached an\namicable resolution of this dispute,\" the Social Media Victims Law Center said of the TikTok settlement,\nadding the terms were confidential. The defendants now include Meta - which owns Instagram and\nFacebook and YouTube parent Google. Snapchat settled with the plaintiff last week.\n'Dangerous and addictive algorithms'\nThe named social media companies have said the plaintiff's evidence falls short of proving they are\nresponsible for alleged harms such as depression and eating disorders. The case going to trial marks a\ndistinct shift in how the US legal system treats tech firms, which face mounting claims that their\nproducts lead to addictive behaviours. The companies have long argued that Section 230 of the\nCommunications Decency Act, passed by Congress in 1996, exempts platforms from liability for what\nthird parties post. But at issue in this case are design choices about algorithms, notifications and other\nfeatures that affect how people use their apps. KGM's attorney, Matthew Bergman, told the BBC the\ncase will be the first time a social media company has been held to account by a jury at trial.\n\"Unfortunately, there are all too many kids in the United States, the UK, and around the world who are\nsuffering as KGM does because of the dangerous and addictive algorithms that the social media\nplatforms foist on unsuspecting kids,\" he said. \"These companies are going to have to explain to a jury\nwhy their profits were more important than the lives of our young people.\" Eric Goldman, a law\nprofessor at Santa Clara University, told the BBC that losing these cases in court could pose an\nexistential threat to the social media companies. But he said it may be difficult for plaintiffs to prove\nphysical harms can be blamed on content publishers. \"The fact that the plaintiffs have been able to sell\nthat idea has opened the door to a whole bunch of new legal questions that the law wasn't really\ndesigned to answer,\" he said.\n'The tech industry has been given deferential treatment'"}

Debunking the Myths and Exploring Crab Health\nNo, blue crabs themselves are not cancerous. While they can be affected by diseases, including some\nthat cause visible deformities, these are not the same as cancer in humans and do not pose a risk to\nconsumers when cooked and handled properly.\nIntroduction: A Deep Dive into Blue Crab Health\nBlue crabs (Callinectes sapidus), a culinary staple of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, are enjoyed by\nmillions. However, misconceptions about their health and safety occasionally surface, leading to\nunderstandable concerns among consumers. The question, “Are blue crabs cancerous?” is a common\none, often fueled by the sight of crabs with unusual growths or disfigurements. This article aims to\nclarify the facts, separating myth from reality and providing a comprehensive understanding of blue\ncrab health.\nUnderstanding Blue Crab Diseases\nBlue crabs, like all living organisms, are susceptible to a variety of diseases. These diseases can be\ncaused by bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi. Some of these conditions can alter the crab’s\nappearance, leading some to believe they are cancerous. However, it’s crucial to distinguish between a\ndisease affecting a crab and the crab being cancerous in a way that poses a risk to human health.\nViral Diseases: Reo-like viruses can cause muscle necrosis in blue crabs, leading to milky or opaque\nareas within the meat.\nReo-like viruses can cause muscle necrosis in blue crabs, leading to milky or opaque areas within the\nmeat. Bacterial Infections: Shell disease, caused by chitinolytic bacteria, can erode the crab’s shell,\ncreating dark lesions.\nShell disease, caused by chitinolytic bacteria, can erode the crab’s shell, creating dark lesions.\nParasitic Infestations: Sacculina, a parasitic barnacle, can infest blue crabs, affecting their reproductive\ncapabilities and altering their appearance.\nSacculina, a parasitic barnacle, can infest blue crabs, affecting their reproductive capabilities and\naltering their appearance. Fungal Infections: Lagenidium callinectes is a common fungus that can infect\ncrab eggs.\nWhat Cancer Actually Is\nIt is important to establish what cancer is in the context of this question. Cancer is a disease caused by\nan uncontrolled division of abnormal cells in a part of the body. These abnormal cells infiltrate and\ndestroy normal body tissue.\nCellular Mutation: Cancer typically arises from mutations in DNA that lead to uncontrolled cell growth.\nCancer typically arises from mutations in DNA that lead to uncontrolled cell growth. Tumor Formation:\nThe unregulated growth of these cells can form tumors that invade surrounding tissues.\nThe unregulated growth of these cells can form tumors that invade surrounding tissues. Metastasis:\nCancer cells can spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body, forming new tumors.\nWhy the Confusion About Blue Crabs and Cancer?\nThe confusion surrounding are blue crabs cancerous? often stems from visual observations. Crabs\nexhibiting unusual growths, shell deformities, or discolored meat might be mistaken for having\ncancerous tumors. However, these abnormalities are usually indicative of infections or parasitic\ninfestations, not cancer in the traditional sense. Shell disease, for example, is a bacterial infection that\nerodes the shell, creating dark lesions. While unsightly, it’s not cancer.\nFood Safety and Blue Crabs\nThe primary concern for consumers is whether eating a blue crab with a visible disease poses a health\nrisk. Generally, properly cooked blue crab meat is safe to eat, even if the crab exhibited signs of\ndisease before cooking. The high temperatures involved in cooking kill most bacteria, viruses, and\nparasites.\nProper Cooking is Key: Cook crabs thoroughly to an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C).\nCook crabs thoroughly to an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C). Discard Diseased Parts: Avoid\neating parts of the crab that appear visibly diseased or discolored, even after cooking.\nAvoid eating parts of the crab that appear visibly diseased or discolored, even after cooking. Handling\nPrecautions: Wash your hands thoroughly after handling raw crabs.\nScientific Evidence\nThere is no scientific evidence suggesting that blue crabs can transmit cancer to humans, or that eating\na blue crab that has a disease, after proper cooking, poses any cancer risk. Studies focus primarily on\nthe pathogens and parasites that affect crabs, rather than cancer development within the crab itself.\nDisease Cause Human Health Risk (Cooked) —————– ———————– —————————–\nShell Disease Bacteria None Viral Infections Viruses None Sacculina Parasitic Barnacle None\nLagenidium callinectes Fungus None\nThe Importance of Sustainable Harvesting\nMaintaining the health of blue crab populations also relies on sustainable harvesting practices.\nOverfishing and habitat destruction can weaken populations, making them more susceptible to disease.\nResponsible fishing practices help ensure the long-term health and availability of this valuable\nresource.\nExpert Opinion\nDr. Emily Carter, a marine biologist specializing in crustacean diseases, stated, “The question, “Are\nblue crabs cancerous?‘ is a common misconception. While blue crabs can contract diseases that affect\ntheir appearance, these conditions are distinct from cancer in humans. Thorough cooking eliminates\nany potential risk associated with these diseases.”\nFrequently Asked Questions About Blue Crabs and Cancer\nIs it safe to eat blue crabs with black spots on their shells?\nBlack spots on a blue crab’s shell are often a sign of shell disease, a bacterial infection that erodes the\nshell. While unsightly, shell disease is not harmful to humans when the crab is properly cooked. The\ncooking process kills the bacteria responsible for the infection.\nCan blue crabs get cancer like humans do?\nWhile crustaceans, including blue crabs, can develop neoplasms (abnormal tissue growth), the\noccurrence of true cancer, with metastasis, is relatively rare and not well-documented in blue crabs.\nThe diseases that visibly affect them are generally bacterial, viral, or parasitic in origin.\nWhat are those orange sacs I sometimes see inside blue crabs?\nThese orange sacs are usually roe (eggs) from a female crab. They are completely safe to eat and\nconsidered a delicacy by some.\nIs the milky or opaque meat in a blue crab safe to eat?\nMilky or opaque meat can be a sign of a viral infection in the crab’s muscles. While cooking usually\nrenders it safe to eat, some people prefer to discard such meat due to its altered texture.\nAre there any parts of a blue crab that I should avoid eating?\nIt’s generally advisable to remove the gills (also known as “dead man’s fingers”) and the intestinal tract\nbefore eating a blue crab. While these parts are not necessarily harmful, they can have an unpleasant\ntaste.\nHow can I tell if a blue crab is fresh and safe to cook?\nA fresh blue crab should smell like the ocean, not ammonia. It should also be lively and active if alive,\nor have a firm texture if dead. Avoid crabs with a strong, foul odor or a mushy texture.\nDoes freezing blue crabs kill any potential diseases?\nFreezing can kill some parasites, but it does not eliminate all potential pathogens. Thorough cooking is\nstill essential for ensuring safety.\nAre blue crabs caught in polluted waters safe to eat?\nBlue crabs caught in polluted waters may accumulate contaminants. It’s important to check with local\nhealth advisories regarding seafood consumption in specific areas.\nCan I get sick from handling raw blue crabs?\nIt’s possible to contract bacterial infections from handling raw blue crabs. Always wash your hands\nthoroughly with soap and water after handling raw seafood.\nWhat is Sacculina, and is it dangerous to humans?\nSacculina is a parasitic barnacle that infests blue crabs. It is not dangerous to humans and poses no\nrisk to those who consume properly cooked crabs.\nAre imported blue crabs as safe to eat as locally caught ones?\nThe safety of imported blue crabs depends on the country of origin and their food safety standards.\nLook for crabs from reputable sources with established quality control measures.\nDoes cooking a dead blue crab make it safe to eat?\nCooking a dead blue crab does not guarantee its safety. Blue crabs decompose quickly after death,\nand the accumulation of bacteria can make them unsafe to eat, even after cooking. It’s best to cook\ncrabs as soon as possible after they die."}

Leaving a dead gopher in its tunnel can attract scavengers, spread disease, and fail to\naddress the underlying gopher problem. The better approach is responsible removal and preventative\nmeasures.\nUnderstanding the Gopher Problem\nGophers, also known as pocket gophers, are burrowing rodents infamous for their destructive tunneling\nactivities. These tunnels can undermine lawns, gardens, agricultural fields, and even building\nfoundations. Understanding their behavior and the consequences of their presence is crucial before\ndeciding what to do with a deceased gopher.\nWhy Leaving a Dead Gopher is a Bad Idea\nLeaving a dead gopher in the tunnel, while seemingly convenient, poses several risks:\nAttracting Scavengers: The carcass attracts scavengers like coyotes, foxes, and even rodents,\npotentially leading to a larger pest problem. These animals may further excavate the area, causing\nmore damage.\nThe carcass attracts scavengers like coyotes, foxes, and even rodents, potentially leading to a larger\npest problem.

Other gophers will likely move into the abandoned\ntunnel system, continuing the damage. Environmental Considerations: Improper disposal can\ncontaminate soil and water sources.\nResponsible Gopher Removal and Disposal\nThe proper approach involves removing the dead gopher and disposing of it safely. Here’s a suggested\nprocedure:\nProtective Gear: Wear gloves (nitrile or latex) to prevent direct contact with the carcass and potential\npathogens. Consider wearing a mask to avoid inhaling dust or odors. Locate the Body: Carefully locate\nthe dead gopher within the tunnel system. Use a shovel or trowel to gently excavate the area. Removal:\nUse the shovel or gloved hands to pick up the gopher. Avoid direct contact as much as possible.\nDisposal: The best disposal method depends on local regulations. Options include: Burial: Dig a hole at\nleast 2-3 feet deep in a location away from water sources and gardens. Cover the body completely with\nsoil.\nDig a hole at least 2-3 feet deep in a location away from water sources and gardens. Cover the body\ncompletely with soil.

Check for any ordinances regarding\nanimal disposal.\nDouble-bag the gopher in plastic bags and dispose of it in a sealed trash container, following local\nwaste disposal guidelines. Check for any ordinances regarding animal disposal. Cremation: Some\nveterinary clinics or animal control services offer cremation services for small animals. Clean and\nDisinfect: Clean and disinfect any tools or surfaces that came into contact with the gopher. Use a\nbleach solution (1 part bleach to 9 parts water) or a commercially available disinfectant.\nPreventing Future Gopher Problems\nAfter removing the dead gopher, focus on preventing future infestations:\nHabitat Modification: Remove food sources like clover and alfalfa that attract gophers.\nRemove food sources like clover and alfalfa that attract gophers.

Using\nPoison Bait Carelessly: If using poison bait, follow instructions carefully and take precautions to protect\npets and wildlife. Consider the ethical implications.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWhat diseases can I get from a dead gopher?\nWhile the risk is generally low, potential diseases include salmonellosis, leptospirosis, and, rarely,\nrabies. Always wear protective gloves and wash your hands thoroughly after handling any dead animal.\nIs it okay to just leave a dead gopher for other animals to eat?\nWhile nature eventually takes its course, leaving a dead gopher out in the open attracts scavengers to\nyour property, which may include unwanted pests. Responsible removal and disposal is preferable.\nWhat if I can’t find the dead gopher in the tunnel?\nThe carcass will eventually decompose, but it will take time and may produce an unpleasant odor. If\nyou can’t locate it, focus on preventing other gophers from using the tunnel system.\nCan I use my bare hands if I don’t think the gopher died of disease?\nNo. Always use protective gloves, regardless of the perceived cause of death. You can never be sure\nof the health status of the animal.\nHow long will it take for a dead gopher to decompose in the tunnel?\nDecomposition time varies depending on temperature, humidity, and soil conditions. It can take weeks\nor even months for the body to fully decompose.\nAre there any legal restrictions on how I can dispose of a dead gopher?\nLocal regulations vary. Check with your local municipality or animal control services for specific\nguidelines on animal disposal.\nWill the other gophers leave the tunnel system if one of them dies inside?\nNo. Gophers are territorial, but the death of one gopher is unlikely to deter others from moving into or\ncontinuing to use the existing tunnel system. The opposite is more likely, especially if there’s an existing\nnetwork of tunnels ready to be used.\nIs it safe to let my dog or cat investigate a dead gopher?\nNo. Prevent your pets from coming into contact with the carcass to protect them from potential diseases\nor parasites.\nWhat’s the best way to prevent gophers from entering my yard in the first place?\nInstall underground fencing around your property or garden.\nRemove food sources like clover and alfalfa.\nConsider using gopher repellents.\nEmploy deterrent methods like ultrasonic devices.\nWill covering up the gopher hole be enough to prevent future problems?\nNo. Covering up the hole only hides the problem temporarily. Gophers will likely dig new tunnels or\nreopen existing ones. You need to address the underlying infestation.\nWhat if I’m squeamish about handling a dead animal?\nConsider contacting a pest control professional or animal control service to handle the removal and\ndisposal for you.\nWhat if Should you leave a dead gopher in the tunnel? the gopher died in my garden and not in a\ntunnel?\nThe principles remain the same. Wear protective gear, remove the carcass, and dispose of it\nresponsibly. It’s even more crucial to remove it promptly from a garden to prevent attracting scavengers\nand avoid contaminating your produce."}

Such inclusive infrastructures enable women to contribute\nmeaningfully, ascend to leadership roles and shape high-impact initiatives that define standards and\ninform policy6.\nAuthorship in peer-reviewed publications and related scholarly work remains a critical determinant of\nacademic advancement, influencing promotion, speaking invitations, collaborative networks and future\nleadership opportunities. There is an urgent need to fortify this pathway for women, particularly those\nhistorically under-represented relative to their male peers7.\nWhile deliberate efforts to advance and support women within professional associations are\nincreasingly emphasized, unconscious replication of systemic practices common in mainstream\nhealthcare institutions — if adopted without scrutiny — can inadvertently perpetuate inequities,\nreinforce male-advantaged norms and undermine equity goals. To counteract these dynamics,\norganizational structures require ongoing evaluation and recalibration to remain aligned with evolving\nequity commitments. A notable example is the deliberate restructuring of guideline-development\nprocesses by a professional medical society, which prioritized early identification of diverse panelists,\nmandated transparent conflict-of-interest disclosures and integrated broad stakeholder perspectives —\ndemonstrating a principled commitment to inclusivity and methodological rigor8.\nChallenges at the individual level also demand substantive attention. Barriers that constrain\nengagement and disproportionately affect women — whether directly or indirectly perpetuated by\nprofessional associations — cannot be dismissed. Financial burdens from membership dues,\nuncompensated participation amid competing clinical and academic responsibilities, insufficient\nmentorship, limited protected academic time, productivity pressures, and subtle or explicit\ndiscouragement from peers or institutional leaders — sometimes influenced by broader political\ndynamics or interpersonal conflicts — impede meaningful involvement and advancement4. Travel to\nregional and national meetings or other leadership activities, though ostensibly gender neutral, may\ndisproportionately burden women with caregiving or logistical responsibilities9. While virtual platforms\nimprove accessibility, in-person participation remains crucial for visibility, networking and leadership\ndevelopment.\nProactive acknowledgment of these constraints, coupled with flexible structures, targeted policy\nadvocacy, leadership initiatives supporting work–life integration, and individual sponsorship programs,\ncan mitigate these barriers, enhance inclusion, foster innovation and accelerate career advancement\nfor women in academia and leadership10.\nAdvancing gender equity in healthcare, across interprofessional and academic domains, requires\nrecognition of both overt and implicit barriers and a sustained commitment to recalibrating cultural and\npolicy frameworks. Progress must extend beyond symbolic representation or quota-based inclusion\ntoward substantive, evidence-informed initiatives and catalytic platforms that cultivate academic talent\nand broaden pathways to high-impact leadership for women in healthcare. Professional medical\nassociations can exemplify this vision of equity-driven reform by dismantling long-standing, deeply\nentrenched obstacles and fostering environments that enable women to realize their full professional\ntrajectory."}

Exposure to pet dander, a\ncomponent of animal fur, is a common eczema trigger, leading to inflammation and uncomfortable skin\nsymptoms.\nUnderstanding Eczema and Its Triggers\nEczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a chronic inflammatory skin condition affecting millions\nworldwide. Characterized by itchy, dry, and inflamed skin, eczema can significantly impact quality of\nlife. While the exact cause of eczema is complex and multifactorial, involving both genetic\npredisposition and environmental factors, certain triggers are known to exacerbate symptoms.\nIdentifying and managing these triggers is crucial for effective eczema management.\nThe Role of Pet Dander\nPet dander, which includes microscopic flecks of skin shed by animals with fur or feathers, is a potent\nallergen. This dander often contains proteins that trigger allergic reactions in sensitive individuals.\nWhen someone allergic to pet dander comes into contact with it, their immune system overreacts,\nleading to the release of histamine and other inflammatory chemicals.\nHow Animal Fur Exacerbates Eczema\nCan animal fur trigger eczema? Absolutely. The presence of animal fur in the environment can\nsignificantly increase the amount of pet dander, increasing the likelihood of exposure and subsequent\nallergic reaction. Furthermore, animal fur can act as a carrier for other allergens, such as dust mites\nand pollen, further compounding the problem for individuals with eczema.\nIdentifying Animal Fur Allergy\nIt is crucial to determine if animal fur is indeed a trigger for your eczema. Common symptoms of an\nanimal fur allergy include:\nItchy skin\nRedness\nHives\nRunny nose\nWatery eyes\nSneezing\nExacerbation of eczema symptoms\nAn allergist can perform skin prick tests or blood tests to confirm an animal fur allergy. These tests\nmeasure your body’s immune response to specific allergens.\nManagement Strategies for Eczema and Animal Fur\nIf you are allergic to animal fur and have eczema, managing your exposure is essential. Here are some\nstrategies to consider:\nAvoidance: The most effective way to manage animal fur allergies is to avoid contact with animals. This\nmay involve limiting visits to homes with pets or considering rehoming your pet if your eczema is\nsevere.\nThe most effective way to manage animal fur allergies is to avoid contact with animals.

Barrier Creams: Apply barrier creams or emollients\nfrequently to protect the skin and help it heal.\nAlternative Pets for Eczema Sufferers\nWhile can animal fur trigger eczema? is a key question, some people still want pets. For those with\neczema who desire pet companionship, consider hypoallergenic pets:\nPet Type Considerations ————— —————————————————————————————\n———————————————————————————- Fish Require a tank and regular\nmaintenance. No dander! Reptiles Some reptiles can carry Salmonella. Reptiles do not produce\ndander, making them a safer option. Some Birds Can produce dust from feathers. Regular cleaning of\nthe cage is important. Choose smaller birds to avoid high dust concentration.\nRemember to consult with an allergist before bringing any pet into your home if you or a family member\nhas eczema.\nThe Emotional Impact\nDealing with eczema and animal allergies can be emotionally challenging. Support groups and\ncounseling can help you cope with the stress and frustration associated with managing these\nconditions. Talking to others who understand what you are going through can provide valuable support\nand encouragement.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is pet dander?\nPet dander refers to the microscopic flecks of skin shed by animals with fur or feathers. This dander\ncontains proteins that can trigger allergic reactions in sensitive individuals, leading to eczema flare-ups.\nIs it just the fur that causes allergies?\nNo, it’s not just the fur itself. The primary allergen is the dander, the dead skin cells that animals shed.\nWhile fur can carry dander and other allergens like pollen and dust, it’s the proteins in the dander that\ntrigger the allergic response.\nAre some dog breeds hypoallergenic?\nWhile no dog breed is truly 100% hypoallergenic, some breeds produce less dander than others. These\nbreeds, such as poodles and Bichon Frises, may be a better choice for individuals with mild eczema,\nbut it’s still essential to spend time with the dog before bringing it home to see if you react.\nCan air purifiers really help?\nYes, air purifiers with HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filters can effectively remove pet dander\nand other allergens from the air. This can significantly reduce your exposure to triggers and help\nalleviate eczema symptoms. Look for air purifiers specifically designed for allergen removal.\nWhat are some effective cleaning strategies?\nRegular cleaning is crucial for managing pet dander. Vacuum frequently with a vacuum cleaner\nequipped with a HEPA filter. Dust regularly with a damp cloth to avoid spreading allergens. Wash pet\nbedding regularly in hot water. Consider using allergen-reducing cleaning products.\nIs it possible to build up immunity to pet dander?\nWhile some people may experience a slight decrease in sensitivity over time, it’s unlikely to build up\ncomplete immunity. Allergen immunotherapy (allergy shots) can help desensitize you to pet dander, but\nit’s a long-term commitment.\nCan I use over-the-counter antihistamines for pet allergies?\nOver-the-counter antihistamines can help relieve allergy symptoms such as itching, sneezing, and\nrunny nose. However, they may not be sufficient to control severe eczema flare-ups. Consult with your\ndoctor about the best course of treatment.\nAre there any natural remedies that can help with eczema triggered by pet dander?\nSome natural remedies, such as applying emollients regularly, using colloidal oatmeal baths, and\navoiding harsh soaps, can help soothe eczema. However, these remedies are unlikely to completely\neliminate the problem if you are allergic to pet dander.\nWhat if I already have a pet and am diagnosed with an allergy?\nThis is a difficult situation. Options include: strict environmental control measures (as described above),\nlimiting the pet’s access to certain areas of the house, bathing the pet frequently, and considering\nallergen immunotherapy. In some cases, rehoming the pet may be the best option for your health.\nCan children develop eczema from being around pets?\nYes, children can develop eczema or have their eczema worsened by exposure to pet dander. If a child\nhas a family history of allergies or eczema, it’s essential to be cautious when introducing pets into the\nhousehold.\nIs there a connection between food allergies and pet allergies in eczema?\nWhile not a direct cause-and-effect relationship, individuals with food allergies are often more prone to\ndeveloping other allergies, including pet allergies. The underlying immune dysfunction may make them\nmore susceptible to various allergens.\nWhat are the long-term effects of untreated eczema triggered by animal fur?\nUntreated eczema can lead to chronic skin inflammation, thickening of the skin (lichenification), and\nincreased susceptibility to skin infections. It can also significantly impact your quality of life, leading to\nsleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression. Seeking appropriate medical care and managing triggers\nlike animal fur is crucial for preventing these long-term effects."}

Title IX prohibits sex discrimination as a condition of receiving federal funding.\nRELATED VIDEO — Chloe Cole Thanks Trump Admin, RFK Jr. for Fighting to Protect Kids from Trans\nSurgeries:\nThe departments concluded in September 2025 that MDE and MSHSL violated Title IX by allowing\nmales to compete in several different sports programs and access female-only intimate facilities, such\nas bathrooms and locker rooms. The Trump administration proposed a Resolution Agreement to\nresolve the violations, which Minnesota ultimately declined, according to the Department of Education.\n“Despite repeated opportunities to comply with Title IX, Minnesota has chosen defiance – continuing to\njeopardize the safety of women and girls, deny them fair competition, and erode their right to equal\naccess in educational programs and activities,” Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a\nstatement. “As Minnesota reels from a massive fraud scandal exposing Governor Tim Walz’s\ndereliction of duty, today’s referral to DOJ underscores the state’s ongoing failure to safeguard its\ncitizens and uphold the rule of law. The Trump Administration will not stop until accountability is\ndelivered for Minnesota’s students.”\n“Minnesota is violating Title IX, and we will not look the other way,” HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy,\nJr. added. “When states allow males to compete in girls’ sports, they deny young women and girls the\nprotections the law guarantees. After Minnesota refused to comply, we referred this case to the\nDepartment of Justice for enforcement.”\nThe Trump administration pointed to several specific incidents of males competing on female teams,\nincluding a trans-identifying male playing on the Champlin girls’ varsity fastpitch softball team since\n2023, and males competing on the girls’ Alpine ski team, the girls’ Nordic ski team, the girls’ lacrosse\nteam, the girls’ track and field team, and the girls’ volleyball team over the past several years.\n“Today’s letter notifies Minnesota that ED and HHS will refer the matter to DOJ for proceedings, which\ncould result in termination of Minnesota’s Federal funding from ED and HHS,” ED said in a press\nrelease.\nKatherine Hamilton is a political reporter for Breitbart News.

It chips away’Opens in new\nwindow ]\nHowever, small changes by employers have a large impact on the wellbeing of neurodivergent\nemployees, she said.\n“Small accommodations go a long way in fostering an inclusive workforce, whether that’s a review of\nhot-desking or creating quiet zones, and this is no longer just a nice-to-have for employees, it is crucial\nto sustained employee success and wellbeing,” Dr Gormley said.\nMore than 80 per cent of participants believed that specific accommodations were necessary for\nneurodivergent employees to be successful at work. Hybrid working, access to quiet spaces and\nflexible start and finish times were identified as the accommodations of priority by neurodivergent staff.\nThe report’s findings “reinforce the need for employers to consider inclusivity in their strategising so that\nall employees have the same opportunity to progress and grow in their careers,” report co-author and\nhead of the school of inclusive and special education at DCU, Dr Aoife Brennan, added.\n[ What does the future workspace look like? It depends where you sitOpens in new window ]\n“Many employers already do just that but as the workplace continues to evolve, and with the\nadvancement of new technologies, it is important that inclusion and opportunity for progression for\neverybody is at the heart of decision-making,” she said.\nThe research was carried out within the DCU centre for inclusive pedagogy, and with support from the\nDCU educational trust and Bank of Ireland."}

Conventional\ntechniques for classifying nuts mostly rely on manually created characteristics like texture, color, shape,\nor edges. These characteristics frequently fall short of capturing the image’s complete complexity,\nparticularly when nuts show tiny visual variances. This research proposes Deep Atrous Context\nConvolution Generative Adversarial Network (DAC-GAN) model that categorize the 8 classes of nuts\nlike brazil nuts, cashew, peanut, pecan nut, pistachio, chest nut, macadamia and Walnut. This research\nuses Common Nut KAGGLE dataset with 4,000 nuts images of 8 nuts classes. The DAC-GAN\napproach overcomes the difficulties of having limited labelled data for nut classification tasks by\nemploying DCGANs’ ability to produce high-quality, synthetic nut images to supplement the dataset.\nThe DCGAN comprises of a discriminator and a generator block. The discriminator block develops the\nability to differentiate between synthetic and real images, while the generator block generates realistic\nnut images from random noise. The real images along with the DCGAN generated images are\nprocessed with feature filtering methods to extract the Corner Key Points Featured (CKPF) nuts\nimages. To further enhance the feature selection, the CKPF edges are extracted from the image that\nprovides unique, geometrically distinctive critical corners to further process for representative learning.\nTo proceed with the effective feature extraction and model learning, the CKPF nuts images are\nprocessed with atrous convolution that capture the intricate details by expanding the receptive field\nwithout losing resolution. The novelty of this work exists by appending the filtration and atrous\nconvolution that acquire the spatial data features from the nut’s images at various resolutions. Atrous\nconvolution was refined by appending the pre-context and post-context block that add the image level\ninformation to the features. The effectiveness of the DAC-GAN model was validated with the traditional\naugmented dataset with all existing filtering images and CNN models. Implementation outcome shows\nthat DAC-GAN found to exhibit high accuracy of 99.83% towards the nuts type classification. The\nsuperiority of the DAC-GAN method over traditional approaches is demonstrated by extensive\nexperiments on augmented and DCGAN generated datasets, which achieve higher classification\naccuracy and generalization across a variety of nut type categorization. The outcome demonstrates\nthat the DCGAN together with atrous convolution have the potential to be an effective tool for\nautomating nut sorting in food industry."}

It will also open up opportunities to underserved\ngroups like women and girls. At least half of all funding will go directly to the 30% most deprived\ncommunities in the UK.\nSports clubs and organisations will also benefit from new goalposts, fencing and new changing\npavilions – all of which help make sites more accessible and sustainable for local communities. To\nensure broader participation beyond football, at least 40% of funded projects must have a multi-sport\noffer. This approach will give more people access to a wider variety of sports and activities, such as\nrugby, cricket, and basketball.\nFull details of all the 991 projects funded through the Multi-Sport Grassroots Facilities Programme in\n2025/26 at time of writing to date are attached and available on GOV.UK.\nToday, the Government has also announced the allocations for the next £85million investment for\n2026/27 for grassroots sports facilities, part of a £400 million boost launched by the Government in\nJune 2025. Applications are now open in England, with Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland to follow.\nThe announcement was made as Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy visited East Kilbride United Community\nSports Club, who received £310,000 across 2024-26 for a new artificial pitch and changing pavilion at\nKirktonholme. The upgraded facility now hosts women’s and girls’ teams, school PE lessons, and a\nwalking football programme supporting men’s mental health.\nIt follows the Government launching the ‘Team Up’ campaign yesterday, which has brought some of the\nUK’s biggest sport stars, sport governing bodies and charities together to tackle male loneliness using\nthe power of sport through a wide range of initiatives across the country. More details are available on\nthe new Team Up website.\nCulture Secretary Lisa Nandy, said:\nThis is sport delivering for the nation. Every pound we invest in grassroots facilities is a pound that\ntakes pressure off our NHS, supports mental and physical health, and opens doors for new community\nmembers to benefit from sport - like women and girls who’ve been shut out for too long. We’re\nsupporting communities that have made do with run-down pitches and crumbling changing rooms for\nyears. This government is turning that around – building the facilities that get people active, bring\ncommunities together, and nurture the next generation of sporting talent.\nRobert Sullivan, Chief Executive of the Football Foundation said:\nHigh quality sports facilities are vital. This season we’ve been celebrating 25 years of game changing\nimpact in the grassroots game thanks to £1.3bn of funding from our partners the Premier League, The\nFA and Government since we started work in 2000. The funding from the Department of Culture, Media\nand Sport, announced today, alongside that of the Premier League and The FA, ensures the Football\nFoundation can continue to deliver the football and multi-sport facilities that inspire people to play, get\nhealthy and come together. Football in England is evolving and we need to ensure the facilities support\nits growth. Guided by our Local Plans we systematically deliver where need is greatest and impact is\nstrongest, creating inclusive opportunities for generations to come. The £68.4m will help us support the\ngrowth of the women’s and girls’ game, provide the facilities that grassroots organisations need, back\nour biggest and best clubs and ensure we know about every pitch and how we can best support them.\nWe are excited about the next year, and look forward to working with our funding partners to continue\nto provide very community with a great place to play.”\nSport England Chief Executive, Simon Hayes said:\nCommunity sport sits at the heart of our society. It brings people together across the UK, helping them\nto connect, have fun and live healthier lives. But none of that is possible if there aren’t enough pitches\nand facilities, designed in the right way and located in the right places. We therefore very much\nwelcome today’s announcement and look forward to working with the Government and our partners to\nensure as many people as possible from all over the country have the chance to participate.\nThrough new local sports facilities or critical upgrades to outdated facilities, the funding will deliver:\nNew 3G grass pitches enabling year-round play regardless of weather\nUpgraded changing pavilions with more appropriate changing facilities for women and girls\nFloodlighting to extend playing hours into evenings and car parking for better accessibility\nNew goalposts, fencing and storage facilities to improve safety and access\nPriority use time slots for women and girls teams at funded sites\nFacilities that can host PE and school activities alongside community use\nSites that support health initiatives and community outreach programmes\nThe funding is designed to promote health, wellbeing and community cohesion, remove the barriers to\nphysical activity for under-represented groups (such as women and girls, people with disabilities, and\nethnic minority communities), and support the Government’s Plan for Change by breaking down\nbarriers to opportunity and delivering an NHS fit for the future.\nToday’s announcement is the latest part of a £400 million boost for grassroots sport facilities\nannounced by the Government in June 2025. £98 million was invested in 2025/26.

The Whisk…\n\nWhy Can’t You Cut a Dog’s Whisker? A Canine Sensory Deep Dive\nCutting a dog’s whiskers is generally strongly discouraged because these specialized hairs play a\ncritical role in their navigation and spatial awareness, acting as crucial sensory tools.\nThe Whisker Wonder: An Introduction\nDogs, like many other mammals, possess whiskers, scientifically known as vibrissae. These aren’t just\nordinary hairs; they are highly sensitive tactile receptors that connect to a dog’s nervous system,\nproviding them with essential information about their surroundings. Understanding the crucial role of\nwhiskers is fundamental to appreciating why you can’t cut a dog’s whisker.\nThe Anatomy of Canine Whiskers\nA dog’s whiskers are significantly different from their regular fur. Key features include:\nDeep Roots: Vibrissae roots are embedded much deeper in the skin than regular hairs.\nVibrissae roots are embedded much deeper in the skin than regular hairs. Rich Nerve Supply: The hair\nfollicles at the base are packed with nerve endings called proprioceptors.\nThe hair follicles at the base are packed with nerve endings called proprioceptors. Muscle Connection:\nSmall muscles at the base allow the dog to actively move and position their whiskers.\nThese anatomical features combine to create an incredibly sensitive sensory system.\nThe Benefits of Canine Whiskers\nWhiskers contribute to a dog’s well-being in several important ways:\nSpatial Awareness: Whiskers help dogs navigate in tight spaces and low-light conditions by detecting\nchanges in air currents. They act like an early warning system, preventing them from bumping into\nobjects.\nWhiskers help dogs navigate in tight spaces and low-light conditions by detecting changes in air\ncurrents. They act like an early warning system, preventing them from bumping into objects. Prey\nDetection: In canines with strong hunting instincts, whiskers are crucial for detecting prey movement,\neven in dense environments.\nIn canines with strong hunting instincts, whiskers are crucial for detecting prey movement, even in\ndense environments. Emotional Communication: The position of a dog’s whiskers can reflect their\nemotional state, signaling curiosity, anxiety, or aggression.\nThe position of a dog’s whiskers can reflect their emotional state, signaling curiosity, anxiety, or\naggression. Eye Protection: Whiskers above the eyes help protect them from debris and foreign\nobjects. They trigger a blink reflex when disturbed.\nThe Potential Consequences of Whisker Removal\nUnderstanding the benefits highlights why you can’t cut a dog’s whisker without potentially causing\nharm. Removal can lead to:\nDisorientation: Dogs might become clumsy and bump into objects more frequently, especially in\nunfamiliar environments.\nDogs might become clumsy and bump into objects more frequently, especially in unfamiliar\nenvironments. Anxiety: Loss of sensory input can cause increased anxiety and stress.\nLoss of sensory input can cause increased anxiety and stress. Difficulty Navigating: Simple tasks like\nwalking through doorways or around furniture can become challenging.\nSimple tasks like walking through doorways or around furniture can become challenging. Compromised\nHunting Abilities: For dogs that still engage in hunting behavior, whisker removal can significantly\nhinder their ability to track and capture prey.\nDistinguishing Normal Shedding from Abnormal Whisker Loss\nOccasional whisker shedding is normal, similar to the loss of regular fur. However, excessive whisker\nloss or breakage could indicate an underlying health issue, such as:\nSkin Infections: Bacterial or fungal infections can weaken the hair follicles.\nBacterial or fungal infections can weaken the hair follicles. Allergies: Allergic reactions can cause\ninflammation and hair loss.\nAllergic reactions can cause inflammation and hair loss. Nutritional Deficiencies: A lack of essential\nnutrients can affect hair health.\nA lack of essential nutrients can affect hair health. Endocrine Disorders: Conditions like hypothyroidism\ncan lead to hair loss, including whiskers.\nIf you notice abnormal whisker loss, consult your veterinarian to rule out any medical causes.\nTrimming vs. Cutting: A Matter of Degree\nWhile completely removing whiskers is strongly discouraged, accidentally trimming the very tip of a\nwhisker is unlikely to cause significant harm. However, it’s still best to avoid trimming them altogether.\nThe full length of the whisker is crucial for optimal sensory function. Why can’t you cut a dog’s whisker?\nBecause even a minor alteration can impact its functionality.\nResponsible Grooming Practices\nWhen grooming your dog, take extra care around the whisker area. Avoid pulling or tugging on them. If\nyou’re using clippers, be mindful of their location to prevent accidental trimming. Educate groomers on\nthe importance of preserving whiskers.\nSummary of Reasons Why Whisker Removal is Bad\nReason Explanation ————————– ———————————————————————————\n—————————————————————————————— Sensory Deprivation Whiskers are\nvital tactile sensors that provide information about the environment. Removing them deprives the dog of\nthis crucial input. Disrupted Navigation Whiskers aid in spatial awareness, especially in low light. Their\nabsence makes it harder for dogs to navigate and avoid obstacles. Increased Anxiety The loss of\nsensory input can lead to heightened anxiety and stress. Compromised Communication Whiskers\ncontribute to a dog’s body language. Their removal can hinder their ability to communicate effectively\nwith other dogs and humans.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWhat exactly are dog whiskers made of?\nDog whiskers, or vibrissae, are made of keratin, the same protein that makes up hair and nails.\nHowever, unlike regular fur, whiskers are thicker, longer, and deeply rooted in the skin.\nAre a dog’s whiskers the same as a cat’s whiskers?\nWhile both dogs and cats have whiskers that serve similar functions, there are slight differences. Cats’\nwhiskers are generally more sensitive and play a more critical role in hunting and navigating extremely\ntight spaces.\nWill a dog’s whiskers grow back if they are accidentally cut?\nYes, a dog’s whiskers will typically grow back if they are accidentally cut. The regrowth process can\ntake several weeks or months, depending on the individual dog and the extent of the cut.\nIs it cruel to cut a dog’s whiskers?\nWhile not physically painful, cutting a dog’s whiskers can be considered cruel due to the sensory\ndeprivation it causes. It’s akin to blindfolding a human and asking them to navigate a crowded room.\nDo all dogs have the same number of whiskers?\nThe number of whiskers can vary slightly between individual dogs, but they typically have a consistent\npattern of whiskers above their eyes, on their muzzle, and under their chin.\nCan puppies be born without whiskers?\nIt is rare for puppies to be born without whiskers. Whisker development usually occurs early in fetal\ndevelopment. The absence of whiskers might indicate a genetic abnormality or developmental issue.\nHow do whiskers help a dog in the dark?\nWhiskers detect subtle changes in air currents caused by nearby objects. This allows dogs to “feel”\ntheir way around in the dark, preventing them from bumping into things.\nAre there any situations where whisker removal is medically necessary?\nIn very rare cases, a veterinarian might need to remove a whisker if it’s severely damaged due to injury\nor disease. However, this is an exception rather than the rule.\nDo blind dogs rely more on their whiskers than sighted dogs?\nBlind dogs heavily rely on their whiskers for spatial awareness and navigation. Their whiskers\nessentially become their “eyes,” providing them with crucial information about their surroundings.\nCan I train my dog to use their whiskers more effectively?\nWhile you can’t directly train a dog to use their whiskers more effectively, you can create environments\nthat encourage them to rely on their senses. Providing them with opportunities to explore different\ntextures and navigate complex environments can help them refine their sensory skills.\nWhat should I do if a groomer accidentally cuts my dog’s whiskers?\nIf a groomer accidentally cuts your dog’s whiskers, it’s essential to communicate your concerns. The\nwhiskers will grow back, but monitor your dog for any signs of disorientation or anxiety in the meantime.\nWhy can’t you cut a dog’s whisker if they seem to be in the way during grooming?\nEven if whiskers seem to be in the way during grooming, their sensory function is crucial. Instead of\ncutting them, gently move them aside or use rounded-tip scissors to carefully trim the fur around them\nwithout touching the whiskers themselves. The importance of whiskers and why you can’t cut a dog’s\nwhisker should be understood by all dog owners."}

Understanding the Risks and Safe Alternatives\nThe short answer is yes, walnuts can be toxic to certain animals, particularly dogs, due to a naturally\noccurring mold called Penicillium. This mold produces toxins that can cause severe neurological\nissues.\nIntroduction: The Walnut and the Animal Kingdom\nWalnuts, a nutritious and readily available nut enjoyed by humans worldwide, present a potential\nhazard to our animal companions. While we appreciate their rich flavor and health benefits, it’s crucial\nto understand that what’s good for us isn’t necessarily good – or even safe – for animals. This article\ndelves into the question: Are walnuts toxic to any animals?, exploring the risks associated with walnut\nconsumption in various species, with a particular focus on dogs. We’ll examine the reasons behind the\ntoxicity, symptoms to watch out for, and safer alternatives to offer your pets. Understanding these\nfactors is paramount to ensuring the health and well-being of your furry, feathered, or scaled friends.\nWhy Walnuts Pose a Threat\nThe primary culprit behind walnut toxicity in animals is the presence of molds, specifically Penicillium.\nThese molds thrive in warm, humid environments and can contaminate walnuts during storage or after\nthey fall from the tree. The toxins produced by these molds, known as mycotoxins, are harmful to\nanimals, particularly dogs.\nJuglone: This is a natural compound present in walnut trees (especially the black walnut tree). While\nless toxic than mycotoxins, large quantities can still cause digestive upset.\nThis is a natural compound present in walnut trees (especially the black walnut tree). While less toxic\nthan mycotoxins, large quantities can still cause digestive upset. Mycotoxins: Produced by molds like\nPenicillium, these toxins can cause a range of symptoms from vomiting and diarrhea to severe\nneurological damage.\nProduced by molds like Penicillium, these toxins can cause a range of symptoms from vomiting and\ndiarrhea to severe neurological damage. Tremorgenic Mycotoxins: These are particularly dangerous\nand cause tremors, seizures, and incoordination.\nIt’s important to distinguish between different types of walnuts. English walnuts (the most commonly\nconsumed variety by humans) are less likely to contain high levels of juglone. However, all walnuts are\nsusceptible to mold growth and mycotoxin contamination. Black walnuts, found in the United States,\nare known to be particularly dangerous due to their higher juglone content and susceptibility to mold.\nAnimals Susceptible to Walnut Toxicity\nWhile dogs are the most commonly reported animals affected by walnut toxicity, other species can also\nbe susceptible.\nDogs: They are highly sensitive to the mycotoxins found in walnuts. Their scavenging nature makes\nthem more likely to ingest moldy or fallen walnuts.\nThey are highly sensitive to the mycotoxins found in walnuts.

Horses: Similar to dogs, horses can develop neurological\nsymptoms after consuming moldy walnuts.\nSimilar to dogs, horses can develop neurological symptoms after consuming moldy walnuts. Livestock:\nWhile less commonly reported, livestock like cattle and pigs can also be affected by mycotoxins in\nwalnuts, particularly if they consume contaminated feed.\nWhile less commonly reported, livestock like cattle and pigs can also be affected by mycotoxins in\nwalnuts, particularly if they consume contaminated feed. Birds: While some bird species can tolerate\nsmall amounts of nuts, moldy walnuts are still harmful and should be avoided.\nSymptoms of Walnut Toxicity\nRecognizing the symptoms of walnut toxicity is crucial for prompt veterinary intervention. The severity\nof symptoms depends on the amount of contaminated walnuts ingested and the animal’s overall health.\nHere’s a list of common symptoms:\nVomiting\nDiarrhea\nLethargy\nLoss of appetite\nTremors\nSeizures\nIncoordination (ataxia)\nWeakness\nDrooling\nIf you suspect your animal has ingested walnuts, particularly if they are displaying any of these\nsymptoms, contact your veterinarian immediately. Early treatment is essential to minimizing the\npotential for long-term damage.\nPrevention is Key: Safe Practices and Alternatives\nThe best approach to walnut toxicity is prevention. Avoid allowing your animals access to walnuts,\nespecially those found on the ground.\nSecure Storage: Store walnuts in airtight containers in a cool, dry place to prevent mold growth.\nStore walnuts in airtight containers in a cool, dry place to prevent mold growth.

Yard Management: If you have walnut trees in your yard, regularly clean\nup fallen walnuts to prevent animals from accessing them. Consider fencing off the area to restrict\naccess.\nIf you have walnut trees in your yard, regularly clean up fallen walnuts to prevent animals from\naccessing them. Consider fencing off the area to restrict access. Safe Alternatives: Offer your pets safe\nand healthy alternatives to walnuts, such as commercially available dog treats, cooked sweet potato, or\nsmall amounts of certain fruits and vegetables. Always consult with your veterinarian about appropriate\ndietary choices for your specific animal.\nTreatment Options for Walnut Toxicity\nIf your pet has ingested walnuts and is showing signs of toxicity, your veterinarian will likely recommend\nthe following:\nEmesis (Induced Vomiting): To remove any undigested walnuts from the stomach.

Supportive Care:\nIntravenous fluids, medications to control tremors and seizures, and other supportive measures to\naddress symptoms.\nThe prognosis for walnut toxicity depends on the severity of the symptoms and the promptness of\ntreatment. With timely veterinary care, many animals can recover fully.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nAre walnuts really that dangerous to dogs?\nYes, walnuts can be quite dangerous to dogs because they are susceptible to mold growth, producing\ntremorgenic mycotoxins. These toxins can cause serious neurological issues, including tremors,\nseizures, and incoordination.\nWhat about other nuts? Are they all toxic?\nNot all nuts are toxic to animals, but some pose risks. Macadamia nuts are known to be toxic to dogs,\nwhile almonds, cashews, and peanuts are generally safe in small quantities but can cause digestive\nupset due to their high fat content. Always offer nuts in moderation and avoid salted or flavored\nvarieties.\nMy dog ate one walnut off the ground. Should I be worried?\nIf your dog ate a single, fresh, mold-free walnut, the risk is relatively low. However, monitor your dog\nclosely for any signs of vomiting, diarrhea, or neurological issues. If you notice anything unusual,\ncontact your veterinarian.\nCan I give my horse walnuts as a treat?\nIt is best to avoid giving horses walnuts. Similar to dogs, horses are susceptible to neurological\nproblems from ingesting moldy walnuts. There are many safer treats available for horses, such as\ncarrots or apples.\nWhat if my pet only ate a small piece of a walnut?\nThe risk is generally lower with smaller quantities, but even a small amount of contaminated walnut can\ncause symptoms. Observe your pet carefully for any signs of illness and contact your veterinarian if you\nare concerned.\nHow quickly will symptoms appear after eating a toxic walnut?\nSymptoms can appear within 30 minutes to several hours after ingestion. The onset time depends on\nthe amount of walnut consumed, the level of contamination, and the animal’s individual sensitivity.\nAre all types of walnuts equally toxic?\nBlack walnuts are generally considered more dangerous due to their higher juglone content and\nsusceptibility to mold growth compared to English walnuts. However, any walnut can become toxic if\ncontaminated with mold.\nIs there an antidote for walnut toxicity?\nThere is no specific antidote for walnut toxicity. Treatment focuses on removing the toxin from the body\n(e.g., induced vomiting, activated charcoal) and providing supportive care to manage the symptoms.\nHow can I tell if a walnut is moldy?\nLook for signs of discoloration, dark spots, or a fuzzy growth on the walnut shell or kernel. Moldy\nwalnuts may also have a musty or unpleasant odor.\nIs it safe to feed walnut oil to my pet?\nWalnut oil is generally considered safe in small quantities, as the toxic components are primarily found\nin the nut itself and the mold that grows on it. However, always consult with your veterinarian before\nadding any new supplement to your pet’s diet.\nWhat are some safe nut alternatives for my dog?\nSmall amounts of plain, unsalted peanuts, cashews, and almonds can be given as occasional treats.\nHowever, always monitor your dog for any signs of digestive upset. Pumpkin seeds and sunflower\nseeds (shelled) are also good choices.\nAre the shells of walnuts also toxic?\nWhile the shells themselves are not inherently toxic, they can be a choking hazard and can cause\ngastrointestinal obstruction if ingested. Keep walnut shells away from your pets to prevent potential\nproblems."}

One in five have become estranged over controversial issues,\nand the same percentage has “blocked a family member on social media or skipped a family event” due\nto disagreements.\nDifficulty working through conflict with those close to us can cause irreparable harm to families and\nrelationships. What’s more, inability to heal these relationships can be detrimental to physical and\nemotional well-being, and even longevity.\nHealing relationships often involves forgiveness – and sometimes we have the ability to truly reconcile.\nBut as a professor and licensed professional counselor who researches forgiveness, I believe the\nprocess is often misunderstood.\nIn my 2021 book, “Practicing Forgiveness: A Path Toward Healing,” I talk about how we often feel\npressure to forgive and that forgiveness can feel like a moral mandate. Consider 18th-century poet\nAlexander Pope’s famous phrase: “To err is human; to forgive, divine” – as though doing so makes us\nbetter people. The reality is that reconciling a relationship is not just difficult, but sometimes inadvisable\nor dangerous, especially in cases involving harm or trauma.\nI often remind people that forgiveness does not have to mean a reconciliation. At its core, forgiveness is\ninternal: a way of laying down ill will and our emotional burden, so we can heal. It should be seen as a\nseparate process from reconciliation, and deciding whether to renegotiate a relationship.\nBut either form of forgiveness is difficult – and here may be some insights as to why:\nForgiveness, karma and revenge\nIn 2025, I conducted a study with my colleagues Alex Hodges and Jason Vannest to explore emotions\npeople may experience around forgiveness, and how those emotions differ from when they experience\nkarma or revenge.\nWe defined forgiveness as relinquishing feelings of ill will toward someone who engaged in a harmful\naction or behavior toward you. “Karma” refers to a situation where someone who wronged you got what\nthey deserved without any action from you. “Revenge,” on the other hand, happens when you retaliate.\nFirst, we prompted participants to share memories of three events related to offering forgiveness,\nwitnessing karma and taking revenge. After sharing each event, they completed a questionnaire\nindicating what emotions they experienced as they retold their story.\nRevenge can feel easier than forgiveness, which often brings sadness or anxiety. nattul/iStock via\nGetty Images Plus\nWe found that most people say they aspire to forgive the person who hurt them. To be specific,\nparticipants were about 1.5 times more likely to desire forgiveness than karma or revenge.\nMost admitted, though, that karma made them happier than offering forgiveness.\nWorking toward forgiveness tended to make people sad and anxious. In fact, participants were about\n1.5 times more likely to experience sadness during forgiveness than during karma or revenge. Pursuing\nforgiveness was more stressful, and harder work, because it forces people to confront feelings that may\noften be perceived as negative, such as stress, anger or sadness.\nTwo different processes\nForgiveness is also confusing, thanks to the way it is typically conflated with reconciliation.\nForgiveness researchers tie reconciliation to “interpersonal forgiveness,” in which the relationship is\nrenegotiated or even healed. However, at times, reconciliation should not occur – perhaps due to a\ntoxic or unsafe relationship. Other times, it simply cannot occur, such as when the offender has died, or\nis a stranger.\nBut not all forgiveness depends on whether a broken relationship has been repaired. Even when\nreconciliation is impossible, we can still relinquish feelings of ill-will toward an offender, engaging in\n“intrapersonal forgiveness.”\nI used to practice counseling in a hospital’s adolescent unit, in which all the teens I worked with were\nconsidered a danger to themselves or others. Many of them had suffered abuse. When I pictured what\n“success” could look like for them, I hoped that, in adulthood, my clients would not be focused on their\npast trauma – that they could experience safety, health, belonging and peace.\nMost often, such an outcome was not dependent upon reconciling with the offender. In fact,\nreconciliation was often ill-advised, especially if offenders had not expressed remorse or commitment to\nany type of meaningful change. Even if they had, there are times when the victim chooses not to\nrenegotiate the relationship, especially when working through trauma.\nStill, working toward intrapersonal forgiveness could help some of these young people begin each day\nwithout the burden of trauma, anger and fear. In effect, the client could say, “What I wanted from this\nperson I did not get, and I no longer expect it.” Removing expectations from people by identifying that\nwe are not likely to get what we want can ease the burden of past transgressions. Eventually, you\ndecide whether to continue to expend the emotional energy it takes to stay angry with someone.\nRelinquishing feelings of ill will toward someone who has caused you harm can be difficult. It may\nrequire patience, time and hard work. When we recognize that we are not going to get what we wanted\nfrom someone – trust, safety, love – it can feel a lot like grief. Someone may pass through the same\nstages, including denial, anger, bargaining and depression, before they can accept and forgive within\nthemselves, without the burden of reconciliation.\nTaking stock\nWith this in mind, I offer four steps to evaluate where you are on your forgiveness journey. A simple tool\nI developed, the Forgiveness Reconciliation Inventory, looks at each of these steps in more depth.\nTalk to someone. You can talk to a friend, mentor, counselor, grandma – someone you trust. Talking\nmakes the unmentionable mentionable. It can reduce pain and help you gain perspective on the person\nor event that left you hurt. Examine if reconciliation is beneficial. Sometimes there are benefits to\nreconciliation. Broken relationships can be healed, and even strengthened. This is especially more\nlikely when the offender expresses remorse and changes behavior – something the victim has no\ncontrol over. In some cases, however, there are no benefits, or the benefits are outweighed by the\noffender’s lack of remorse and change. In this case, you might have to come to terms with processing\nan emotional – or even tangible – debt that will not be repaid. Consider your feelings toward the\noffender, the benefits and consequences of reconciliation, and whether they’ve shown any remorse and\nchange. If you want to forgive them, determine whether it will be interpersonal – talking to them and\ntrying to renegotiate the relationship – or intrapersonal, in which you reconcile your feelings and\nexpectations within yourself.\nEither way, forgiveness comes when we relinquish feelings of ill will toward another."}

The post Science-Based Analysis Suggests Microplastic Hype Brews Faster Than\nSupportive Evidence first appeared on Le·gal In·sur·rec·tio…\n\nI recently reported that a woman was suing the makers of Ziploc bags for failure to warn about\nmicroplastic exposure.\nI have covered the topic of microplastics before, as it looks like it might be revving up to be the next big\nenvironmental cause to target big business and corporate dollars. For example, hard on the heels of\nthe lawsuit comes a report linking microplastic exposure to coffee consumption.\nYour coffee cups might be a factory of microplastics, and you are likely drinking a bunch of them.\nGrabbing a to-go cup of hot beverage while running errands or heading for office is oddly satisfying, but\nyou may not know the damage those plastic cups can do. According to the Environmental Protection\nAgency, the U.S. produces an approximate of 25 billion polystyrene cups every year, or about 82 cups\nper person, as per Medium. In Australia, 1.45 billion single-use coffee or hot beverage cups are thrown\nout annually. In a new study published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials: Plastics, researchers\nfocused on the impact of heat on plastic cups, and the results were concerning. The finding revealed\nthat heat causes microplastilcs to release, making consumers prone to drinking them.\nInterestingly, The Guardian had published several stories about microplastics. Now the publication is\nsharing a detailed account of the challenges faced by studies that have reported microplastics\ncollecting in tissues. The piece highlighted one of their own reports, which asserted that human brain\ntissue was being affected.\nHowever, by November, the study had been challenged by a group of scientists with the publication of\na “Matters arising” letter in the journal. In the formal, diplomatic language of scientific publishing, the\nscientists said: “The study as reported appears to face methodological challenges, such as limited\ncontamination controls and lack of validation steps, which may affect the reliability of the reported\nconcentrations.” One of the team behind the letter was blunt. “The brain microplastic paper is a joke,”\nsaid Dr Dušan Materi■, at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Germany. “Fat is\nknown to make false-positives for polyethylene. The brain has [approximately] 60% fat.” Materi■ and\nhis colleagues suggested rising obesity levels could be an alternative explanation for the trend reported\nin the study. Materi■ said: “That paper is really bad, and it is very explainable why it is wrong.” He\nthinks there are serious doubts over “more than half of the very high impact papers” reporting\nmicroplastics in biological tissue.\n.@Mutnodjmet Relevant to your LI article on microplastics and loony lawsuits, you might find this article\ninteresting. https://t.co/NpotO2Ks8V — Phineas Fahrquar (@irishspy) January 21, 2026\nAnother article, published in Toxicological Sciences, criticizes a study that claims to find microplastics in\ndog and human testicles and links them to lower sperm counts and changes in organ weight.\nThe authors of the letter argue that the original study’s methods were insufficient to support such\nclaims, mainly because there was insufficient information about how samples were collected, stored,\nand processed to rule out contamination. They note that important quality checks—like blanks, controls,\nand clear detection limits—were not reported, so it is impossible to know whether the reported\nmicroplastic levels are real or could be false positives. They also point out missing details on how\ntissues were digested and separated, and that the study did not visually confirm particle size and\nshape, which are important for understanding how particles might affect biology.\nThe authors further question the use and validation of the pyrolysis–GC/MS method for measuring\nmicroplastics in biological tissues in this context, noting that key performance characteristics, such as\nprecision, detection limits, the use of internal standards, and handling of difficult polymers like PVC and\nPET, were not addressed.\nFinally, the contributors to this piece argue that real science must be applied to the study of\nmicroplastics. They argue that only with robust, reproducible methods and larger, well■designed\nstudies can researchers truly determine whether microplastics accumulate in the brain and whether\nthey affect human health.\nGiven the amount of fraud in science publication, and the pressure for academics to fund their\nlaboratories using our tax dollars to “save the planet” and “protect the children”, it is heartening to see\nnews publications beginning to share articles that challenge a newly emerging narrative.\nImage by perplexity.ai\nDonations tax deductible\nto the full extent allowed by law."}

As an Offensive Coordinator, his system which encourages multiple passes and cuts\nhas resulted the Raptors finishing in the top 7 in assists in each of his first two seasons (and currently\n2nd this year). As a Defensive Coordinator, Darko’s schemes and rotations have boosted the Raptors\nfrom the 17th-ranked defense last season to 4th, as of this writing.\nOne hat I did not think Darko would wear was that of a psychic. Back in October 2023, before his first\ngame as Head Coach, Rajakovic proclaimed, “I think one day he’s going to be Defensive Player of the\nYear. That’s something he wants to be, that he wants to develop into, and I’m going to do everything in\nmy power to help him on that path.” (You can disregard the heaps of praise he bestows on Dennis\nSchroder. That definitely does not fall into the ‘psychic’ category, but the ‘head coach’ category of\nDarko’s hats)\nBarnes has been a revelation this year. Not the kind of revelation where a player comes out of nowhere\nto shock everyone, but a revelation to the rest of the NBA. Scottie has been a defensive menace\nthroughout his five seasons in the league. However, playing for lottery teams in each of the last two\nseasons, preceded by two seasons under Nick Nurse where he wasn’t fully unleashed has kept Barnes’\ndefensive reputation at bay. Locally, Raptors fans are well aware of what Scottie brings to the table\ndefensively, night in and night out.\nThis season has been an endless stream of defensive highlights. From blocking LeBron James in the\nfinal minute of a tie game, to blocking Collin Sexton to secure a victory over Charlotte, to blocking a\npotential game-tying mid-range attempt by Chet Holmgren, Barnes’ defense has become a regular\nfixture in Toronto’s game recaps. Not only is he saving the Raptors, but also looking out for people’s\nhealth! What a saint!\nThe stats match what the eyes see. Scottie Barnes’ name is all over the defensive stats pages. Barnes\nis (big inhale):\n#1 in total stocks\n#1 in blocks in the 4th quarter\n#1 in blocks in the clutch (under 5 minutes, margin within 5 points)\n#3 in defensive win shares\nthe only player in the NBA with at least 60 steals AND 60 blocks\nThe individual numbers only paint part of the picture of Barnes’ impact. Check the last sentence of the\nfirst paragraph again. Your eyes do not deceive you. The Toronto Raptors have the 4th-best defense in\nthe league! The team’s other above-average defenders have either been injured (Jakob Poeltl),\ninconsistent (Ja’Kobe Walter), or have only started to play more minutes (Collin Murray-Boyles). Jamal\nShead has been solid, but nowhere near the impact of Barnes.\nScottie’s DPOY case only becomes stronger when considering Poeltl’s been out since mid-December.\nThe Raptors have played 18 games without a true Center…..and its defensive rating has increased!\nThe current buzz around Barnes is nice to see, but Raptors fans know it will take a lot more than stats\nand highlights to win over the voters. Let’s take a look at the 3 players with better DPOY odds — Chet\nHolmgren, Victor Wembanyama, and Rudy Gobert.\nChet Holmgren: Teamwork makes Chet’s dream work\nThe case for Chet is clear as day: he’s the anchor behind the league’s best defense. Holmgren ranks\n#1 in defensive win shares, #2 in defensive rating, and #3 in blocks per game. The individual numbers,\ncombined with the potentially record-breaking defensive numbers — the gap between OKC’s 105.4\ndefensive rating and 2nd-place San Antonio’s 108.6 defensive rating would be the largest margin in\nNBA history — justifies Holmgren’s place at the top of the betting odds.\nHowever, take a closer look at the rankings and their may be a kink in his armor. Just behind Chet in\nthe defensive win shares standings is Shai Gilgeous-Alexander (2nd), Cason Wallace (4th), and Ajay\nMitchell (8th). In the defensive rating list, Holmgren is followed by Wallace (3rd), Mitchell (7th), SGA\n(10th), and Lu Dort (13th). Is it a stretch to think that Wallace, who ranks 1st in total steals and 3rd in\nsteals per game, might steal some votes from Chet? Is the Thunder’s defense more of a collective\neffort rather than an individual? If Chet misses a game, there are still 3-4 other premium defenders\nready to pick up the slack! (That group doesn’t even include Alex Caruso, 2-time All-Defense, or Jalen\nWilliams, who was on last season’s All-Defense team)\nAlso, if the voting came down to Scottie vs. Chet, Barnes might have a leg up.\nVictor Wembanyama: Out of this world and out of the running?\nThe case for and against Wemby is set for the next decade (assuming the league keeps the ridiculous\n65-game rule): if Victor is healthy enough to play the minimum number of required games, he should be\nthe favourite to win DPOY. Every. Single. Year.\nAs it stands right now, Wemby has missed 14 games already this season. If he misses 4 games or\nmore the rest of the way, he will be ineligible for the award.\nRudy Gobert: Sure but why?\nOutside of citizens from Minnesota and France, who can tell me why Gobert is in the ‘favourites’ tier\nwith Holmgren and Wembanyama?\nMinnesota’s 10th-ranked defense is lower than Toronto. Gobert ranks lower than Barnes in defensive\nrating, defensive win shares, and defensive box plus/minus. Rudy doesn’t have the same defensive\ndemands since he plays alongside 2 wings, Anthony Edwards and Jaden McDaniels (Did I\ndouble-check I had the right McDaniels? You’ll never know.), who are better defenders than any Raptor\nother than Barnes. So, Gobert is more deserving than Barnes because he averages 2.9 more rebounds\nand 0.2 more blocks? Is this a legacy thing? Make it make sense, oddsmakers!\nIs Barnes ready to buck the trend?\nThe obvious theme between Holmgren, Wembanyama, and Gobert is that they’re all paint-devouring,\nrim-protecting Centers. From Bill Russell to Hakeem Olajuwon to David Robinson to Shaquille O’Neal,\nthe Defensive Player of the Year award has defaulted to big men for as long as the honour has existed.\nBut in the current NBA, when switching and rotating and scrambling are the name of the defensive\ngame, there’s nothing more valuable than a player who can defend all 5 positions a perfectly as Scottie\nBarnes.\nHe already has a better case than Gobert. He outperformed Holmgren — both statistically and visually\n— in a matchup that will stick in voters’ minds. He is 4 more missed games from not having to worry\nabout an alien. Scottie Barnes has the statistical profile, the eye-popping highlights, and is gaining\ntraction as this year’s Defensive Player of the Year."}

Expert Insights\nThe short answer: No, you should not give your hamster a water bath or a dust bath designed for\nchinchillas. Instead, hamsters clean themselves diligently.\nUnderstanding Hamster Hygiene: More Than Meets the Eye\nHamsters are known for their meticulous grooming habits. These little creatures spend a significant\nportion of their waking hours keeping themselves clean. Their grooming routines involve constant\nlicking and combing of their fur, removing dirt, debris, and excess oils. So, the question “Can I give my\nhamster a dust bath?” actually raises a key misunderstanding of how hamsters clean themselves and\nwhat their skin requires.\nThe Dangers of Water Baths\nContrary to what some might believe, hamsters should never be given water baths. There are several\nreasons for this:\nStress: Hamsters are easily stressed, and being submerged in water can cause significant anxiety and\nfear. This stress can weaken their immune system, making them more susceptible to illness.\nHamsters are easily stressed, and being submerged in water can cause significant anxiety and fear.\nThis stress can weaken their immune system, making them more susceptible to illness. Hypothermia:\nHamsters are small and can quickly lose body heat when wet, especially in cooler environments.

Water baths can strip away these oils, leading to\ndry skin, irritation, and even infection. Respiratory Infections: If water enters a hamster’s ears or nose, it\ncan lead to respiratory infections, which can be fatal.\nThe Problem with Chinchilla Dust Baths\nIf water is a problem, can I give my hamster a dust bath meant for a chinchilla? The answer is still no.\nChinchilla dust is typically made from volcanic ash or very fine clay.\nRespiratory Issues: The fine particles of chinchilla dust can be easily inhaled by hamsters, causing\nrespiratory irritation and potentially leading to more serious lung problems.\nThe fine particles of chinchilla dust can be easily inhaled by hamsters, causing respiratory irritation and\npotentially leading to more serious lung problems. Eye Irritation: The dust can also irritate the hamster’s\neyes, causing redness, discomfort, and potential damage.\nThe dust can also irritate the hamster’s eyes, causing redness, discomfort, and potential damage. Skin\nIrritation: While hamsters need to keep clean, chinchilla dust is often too abrasive for their delicate skin,\nleading to dryness, itching, and inflammation.\nWhat Should You Do? Spot Cleaning and Environmental Hygiene\nInstead of forcing baths, focus on maintaining a clean and healthy living environment for your hamster.\nRegular Cage Cleaning: Clean your hamster’s cage thoroughly at least once a week, removing all\nsoiled bedding and replacing it with fresh bedding.\nClean your hamster’s cage thoroughly at least once a week, removing all soiled bedding and replacing\nit with fresh bedding. Spot Cleaning: Daily spot cleaning involves removing any visible messes, such as\nurine-soaked bedding or uneaten food.\nDaily spot cleaning involves removing any visible messes, such as urine-soaked bedding or uneaten\nfood. Safe Substrates: Use appropriate bedding materials, such as paper-based bedding or aspen\nshavings. Avoid cedar or pine shavings, as they contain oils that can be harmful to hamsters.\nUse appropriate bedding materials, such as paper-based bedding or aspen shavings. Avoid cedar or\npine shavings, as they contain oils that can be harmful to hamsters. Sand Bath (Optional, and with\nSupervision): Some hamster owners provide a shallow dish of reptile sand (calcium-free and dye-free)\nfor their hamsters to roll around in. This is NOT a dust bath, but more of a sandy spa. Some hamsters\nenjoy it, and others ignore it. If you choose to offer this, monitor your hamster closely and remove the\nsand if it appears to cause any irritation.\nAddressing Specific Cleaning Concerns\nIf your hamster has a specific area that needs cleaning (e.g., a matted spot of fur), you can use a damp\n(not wet) cloth to gently wipe the area. Be sure to dry the area thoroughly afterward. If your hamster is\nparticularly dirty or matted, consult with a veterinarian for advice.\nCleaning Method Suitable for Hamsters? Why/Why Not? :——————- :———————-\n:—————————————————————————– Water Bath NO Stressful, can cause\nhypothermia, strips natural oils, risk of infection. Chinchilla Dust Bath NO Fine particles cause\nrespiratory and eye irritation, abrasive to skin. Damp Cloth YES (Spot Cleaning Only) Safe for targeted\ncleaning when used gently and followed by thorough drying. Sand Bath (Reptile) YES (with\nsupervision) Mimics natural behaviors and can keep fur clean, but watch for irritation.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nMy hamster smells. What can I do?\nThe most common cause of odor in hamster cages is simply uncleanliness. Ensure you’re performing\nregular cage cleaning and spot cleaning. A dirty cage quickly becomes a breeding ground for bacteria,\nleading to unpleasant smells. Also, check your hamster’s scent glands. Some hamsters may release a\nmusky scent when stressed or scared, which is normal but can contribute to the overall odor.\nMy hamster has matted fur. How should I clean it?\nAvoid using water. Instead, try gently brushing the matted fur with a soft-bristled brush. If the matting is\nsevere, trim the fur carefully with small, blunt-nosed scissors, being extremely cautious not to cut the\nskin. If you’re uncomfortable doing this yourself, a veterinarian can assist.\nCan I use baby wipes to clean my hamster?\nAbsolutely not. Most baby wipes contain chemicals and fragrances that can be harmful to hamsters if\ningested or absorbed through their skin. If you need to use a wipe, a damp, plain cloth is a much safer\nalternative.\nWhat kind of bedding is best for keeping my hamster clean?\nPaper-based bedding and aspen shavings are generally considered the best options. They are\nabsorbent, relatively dust-free, and do not contain harmful oils like cedar or pine shavings. Avoid\nscented bedding, as the artificial fragrances can be irritating.\nIs it okay if my hamster grooms himself constantly?\nGrooming is a natural behavior for hamsters. However, excessive grooming that leads to hair loss or\nskin irritation could indicate a problem, such as mites, allergies, or stress. If you notice any of these\nsigns, consult a veterinarian.\nCan I use a toothbrush to brush my hamster?\nA very soft-bristled baby toothbrush can be used gently to help remove loose fur and debris from your\nhamster’s coat. However, be extremely gentle and avoid brushing too hard, as you could irritate their\nskin.\nWhat if my hamster gets poop stuck to his fur?\nIf poop gets stuck to your hamster’s fur, gently try to remove it with a damp cloth. If it’s stubborn, you\ncan try trimming the affected fur carefully. Avoid pulling or tugging, as this can hurt your hamster.\nCan I use dry shampoo on my hamster?\nNo, never use dry shampoo intended for humans on your hamster. The ingredients are often toxic and\ncan cause severe irritation and health problems.\nWhat do I do if my hamster gets sticky stuff on his fur?\nIf your hamster gets something sticky on its fur (e.g., honey or syrup), try to remove it with a damp cloth\nsoaked in warm water. If that doesn’t work, consult a veterinarian for advice.\nHow often should I change my hamster’s water?\nYour hamster’s water should be changed daily to ensure it is fresh and clean. This will help prevent the\ngrowth of bacteria and keep your hamster healthy.\nCan I give my hamster a bath in the sink?\nAbsolutely not. The sink is a dangerous environment for a hamster.

The new guidance aims to help people make more informed choices and know\nwhat to do if something doesn’t feel right.\nMHRA Chair and professor of primary care at the University of Oxford, Professor Anthony Harnden,\nsaid:\n“When someone turns to a tool to help with their mental health, they need to know it is safe, effective,\nand built on reliable evidence. Our aim is to give people clear, practical advice they can use in everyday\nlife, so they understand what good looks like and when to speak up if something doesn’t feel right.\n“As a GP, I’ve seen how patients can benefit from accessing digital tools alongside traditional forms of\ncare. This guidance supports better conversations between clinicians and patients and helps everyone\nask the right questions about whether a tool is right for them.\n“Digital mental health technologies are not a replacement for professional healthcare. Anyone\nexperiencing mental health difficulties should seek support from trained professionals.”\nFive things to check before using a digital mental health tool:\n1. What is it claiming to do?\nDoes the product offer general wellbeing support, or does it claim to diagnose, treat or manage a\nmental health condition? Claims about medical benefit should be clearly explained and supported by\nevidence.\n2. Who is it for?\nA tool built for adults may not be suitable for teenagers or children. Age and intended users should be\nclearly stated.\n3. Is there evidence it works?\nTrustworthy products will explain how they have been tested or evaluated, for example in a clinical\nstudy. Be cautious of products making big promises without clear supporting information.\n4. What happens to your data?\nThese tools often collect very sensitive personal information. You should be able to easily find out how\nyour data is stored and used.\n5. Is it is regulated as a medical device?\nSome digital mental health technologies are classed as medical devices, for example those claiming to\ndiagnose, treat or manage a mental health condition. These must meet safety standards and display a\nCE or UKCA mark. People can look for the marking and check whether the product is registered using\nthe MHRA’s online public register. This gives you extra reassurance, as it means it meets UK safety\nstandards, is registered with the MHRA and is monitored once in use.\nNot all digital mental health technologies are regulated as medical devices – some are instead classed\nas wellbeing or lifestyle products. This does not necessarily mean they are unsafe, but they may not\nhave been through the same checks.\nIf a regulated digital mental health technology causes harm or distress, you can report concerns to the\nMHRA Yellow Card scheme.\nWhat the new resources offer\nThe new online resources use short animations and real-world examples to show what safe,\nwell-evidenced digital mental health technologies look like in practice, and explain how to report\nconcerns through the MHRA Yellow Card scheme so action can be taken to protect others.\nThe guidance is aimed at anyone using these technologies, as well as parents and carers, and includes\nprofessionals who often recommend them, including teachers, nurses, GPs and mental health\npractitioners.\nThe resources have been developed by the MHRA in partnership with NHS England’s MindEd\nTechnology Enhanced Learning programme as part of a Wellcome-funded project to support the safe\nand effective use of digital mental health technologies.\nSince its start in 2023, the MHRA, in collaboration with the National Institute for Health and Care\nExcellence (NICE) has focused on proportionate regulation and evaluation in the fast-moving area of\ndigital mental health technologies, working closely with people with lived experience, mental health\nspecialists, developers and international partners.\nChief Scientific Officer at NICE, Dr Nick Crabb, said:\n“Our role at NICE is to help practitioners and commissioners get the best care to people, fast, while\nensuring value for the taxpayer. As digital mental health technologies become more widely used, it’s\nvital that people can access tools that are safe, effective and built on robust evidence.\n“These new resources will help people ask the right questions and make informed choices. This\nmatters now more than ever, as the government’s 10 Year Health Plan expands NICE’s technology\nappraisal process to cover devices, diagnostics and digital products for the first time. Our collaboration\nwith the MHRA and Wellcome is helping to lay the groundwork for this – ensuring that innovation in\nmental health is matched by rigorous, proportionate evaluation so that the best digital tools can reach\nthose who need them.”\nHead of Digital Technology, Discovery Research and Mental Health at Wellcome, Matthew Brown,\nsaid:\n“As more people turn to digital mental health technologies for support, we need practical ways for\nregulators, developers, and healthcare providers to work together so that safe, effective interventions\nreach those who need them.\n“These technologies offer transformative opportunities and we need better evidence to understand\nwhat works, for whom, and in which contexts. Our partnership with MHRA and NICE over the coming\nyears reflects this commitment, bringing research, policy, and innovation together to create earlier and\nmore effective support for anxiety, depression, and psychosis.”\nThe Health Minister in Northern Ireland, Mike Nesbitt said:\n“Digital tools give people information at their fingertips, helping them understand their conditions better,\nwhich can help them take greater control of their mental health and take steps to find tailored solutions.\nI welcome this new resource, which will allow people to make more informed choices around which\napps are safe and effective, based on evidence.\n“For me, health literacy is both about understanding your own health and also how to navigate a\ncomplex Health and Social Care system. Apps will prove to be highly accessible tools in improving\nhealth literacy. It is important people have confidence in the Apps they may rely upon.”\nHead of Information at Mind, Stephen Buckley, said:\n“It’s really important that people can understand what good support looks like. Digital tools such as\nthese are a useful way for people to access information and help alongside more traditional mental\nhealth support.”\nThe MHRA are encouraging anyone using mental health apps or other technologies – or supporting\nsomeone who does – to explore the new guidance and report any concerns, helping to improve safety\nfor everyone.\nNotes to editors"}

It\nrequires patience and understanding of the ferret’s anatomy to avoid cutting the quick.\nUnderstanding the Importance of Ferret Nail Trimming\nMany ferret owners are surprised to learn just how important nail trimming is for their furry friends.\nUnlike cats, ferrets cannot fully retract their claws. This leaves them vulnerable to catching on fabrics,\nfurniture, and even their own bedding. Overgrown nails can also lead to:\nDiscomfort and pain: Long nails can curl back into the paw pads, causing significant discomfort and\npotential infection.\nLong nails can curl back into the paw pads, causing significant discomfort and potential infection.\nDifficulty walking: Overgrown nails can alter a ferret’s gait, leading to muscle strain and joint problems\nover time.\nOvergrown nails can alter a ferret’s gait, leading to muscle strain and joint problems over time.\nIncreased risk of injury: A snagged nail can easily be ripped out, causing bleeding and pain.\nA snagged nail can easily be ripped out, causing bleeding and pain. Damage to furniture and\nbelongings: While perhaps less crucial than the ferret’s well-being, keeping nails trimmed can help\npreserve your home.\nTherefore, regularly trimming your ferret’s nails is a vital part of responsible ferret ownership.\nPreparing for the Nail Trimming Process\nBefore you even think about bringing the clippers near your ferret, preparation is key. This will help\nensure a smooth and stress-free experience for both you and your pet. Here’s what you need:\nSmall animal nail clippers: Choose a pair specifically designed for small animals. Human nail clippers\nare not suitable, as they can crush the nail instead of cutting it cleanly. Scissor-type clippers or\nguillotine clippers are popular choices.\nChoose a pair specifically designed for small animals.

Good lighting: You need to be able to clearly see the nail and\nthe quick.\nYou need to be able to clearly see the nail and the quick. A calm and quiet environment: Choose a time\nwhen your ferret is relaxed and less likely to be fidgety.\nStep-by-Step Guide: How Do You Clip a Ferret’s Nails?\nHere’s a breakdown of how do you clip a ferret’s nails safely and effectively:\nGet your ferret comfortable: Start by handling your ferret’s paws frequently to get them used to being\ntouched. Associate paw handling with positive reinforcement, such as treats. Find the right position:\nYou can hold your ferret in your lap, place them on a table, or have someone else hold them. The key is\nto find a position where you can comfortably and safely access their paws. Isolate a nail: Gently hold\nyour ferret’s paw and isolate one nail at a time. Identify the quick: The quick is the pink part of the nail\nthat contains blood vessels and nerves. You want to avoid cutting this at all costs. In ferrets with clear\nnails, the quick is easy to see. If your ferret has dark nails, you’ll need to trim small amounts at a time to\navoid cutting it. Clip the nail: Using your nail clippers, carefully clip the sharp tip of the nail, avoiding the\nquick. Clip at a slight angle, following the natural curve of the nail. Repeat for all nails: Repeat the\nprocess for each nail, one paw at a time. Reward your ferret: Once you’re finished, reward your ferret\nwith a treat and plenty of praise.\nCommon Mistakes and How to Avoid Them\nEven with careful preparation, mistakes can happen. Here are some common mistakes to avoid when\nclipping your ferret’s nails:\nCutting the quick: This is the most common mistake and can be painful for your ferret. Always err on the\nside of caution and trim small amounts at a time. If you do accidentally cut the quick, apply styptic\npowder immediately to stop the bleeding.\nThis is the most common mistake and can be painful for your ferret.

Always use sharp, high-quality clippers.\nDull clippers can crush the nail instead of cutting it cleanly, which can be painful and uncomfortable for\nyour ferret. Always use sharp, high-quality clippers. Trying to rush the process: Ferrets can be squirmy,\nand it’s tempting to rush the process. However, rushing can increase the risk of making mistakes. Take\nyour time and be patient.\nFerrets can be squirmy, and it’s tempting to rush the process. However, rushing can increase the risk of\nmaking mistakes. Take your time and be patient. Forcing your ferret: If your ferret is struggling or\nbecoming distressed, stop and try again later. Forcing them will only make them more resistant to the\nprocess in the future.\nAlternative Methods for Nail Maintenance\nWhile clipping is the most common method, some ferret owners use alternative methods to help\nmaintain their pet’s nails:\nScratching posts: Although not as effective as clipping, scratching posts can help to wear down the\nnails naturally.\nAlthough not as effective as clipping, scratching posts can help to wear down the nails naturally.\nFerreton-safe sandpaper: Some owners use ferret-safe sandpaper to gently file down the nails.\nThese methods can be used in conjunction with clipping to help keep your ferret’s nails healthy.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWhat type of clippers are best for ferrets?\nThe best types of clippers for ferrets are small animal nail clippers, either the scissor-type or the\nguillotine type. Avoid using human nail clippers, as they can crush the nail and cause discomfort.\nChoose clippers that are sharp and easy to handle.\nHow often should I clip my ferret’s nails?\nThe frequency of nail trimming depends on the individual ferret’s growth rate and activity level.\nHowever, most ferrets need their nails trimmed every 2-4 weeks.\nWhat do I do if I cut the quick?\nIf you accidentally cut the quick, don’t panic. Apply styptic powder to the bleeding nail immediately.\nApply pressure for a few seconds until the bleeding stops. Keep a close eye on the paw for any signs of\ninfection.\nMy ferret hates having their nails clipped. What can I do?\nIf your ferret resists nail trimming, try to make the experience more positive. Start by handling their\npaws frequently and associating it with treats. Trim only a few nails at a time and reward them after\neach one. You can also try clipping their nails when they’re sleepy or distracted.\nCan I take my ferret to a groomer to have their nails clipped?\nYes, many groomers offer nail trimming services for small animals, including ferrets. If you’re\nuncomfortable clipping your ferret’s nails yourself, this is a great option.\nIs it safe to use human nail clippers on ferrets?\nNo, it is not recommended to use human nail clippers on ferrets. Human nail clippers are designed for\nhuman nails, which are different in structure and thickness compared to ferret nails. Using human nail\nclippers can crush or split the ferret’s nails, causing pain and injury.\nWhat if my ferret has dark nails and I can’t see the quick?\nClipping dark nails requires extra caution. Trim very small amounts at a time and watch the cut surface\nof the nail. As you get closer to the quick, you’ll see a small, dark circle appear in the center of the cut\nsurface. Stop trimming when you see this circle.\nIs it okay if my ferret’s nails are a little long?\nIdeally, your ferret’s nails should be kept at a length where they don’t interfere with their movement or\npose a risk of injury. While a little length may not be immediately harmful, regular trimming is essential\nto prevent problems.\nCan I use an emery board to file my ferret’s nails?\nYes, you can use an emery board to file your ferret’s nails, but it’s a much slower process than clipping.\nThis method is best for smoothing rough edges after clipping or for maintaining nail length between\nclippings. Ensure the emery board is smooth and not too coarse.\nMy ferret is very squirmy and won’t stay still. What can I do?\nIf your ferret is very squirmy, try wrapping them in a towel like a “ferret burrito.” This can help to restrain\nthem and make it easier to clip their nails. You can also try having someone else hold them while you\nclip their nails. Patience is key!\nAre there any special considerations for clipping senior ferrets’ nails?\nSenior ferrets may have more brittle nails, so extra care is needed to prevent splitting or cracking. Use\nsharp clippers and trim slowly and carefully.\nWhere can I find small animal nail clippers and styptic powder?\nYou can find small animal nail clippers and styptic powder at most pet stores or online retailers that sell\npet supplies. Look for reputable brands that are known for their quality and safety."}

The Amphibian’s Predicament\nPutting an axolotl out of water is severely detrimental to its health and survival; these aquatic\namphibians rely entirely on water for respiration and hydration, leading to rapid dehydration,\nsuffocation, and ultimately, death.\nAxolotls: A Brief Introduction\nAxolotls, Ambystoma mexicanum, are fascinating aquatic salamanders native to Mexico. Unlike many\namphibians that metamorphose into terrestrial forms, axolotls retain their larval features throughout\ntheir lives, a phenomenon called neoteny. This means they keep their external gills and remain fully\naquatic. They are popular pets due to their unique appearance and relatively easy care, but\nunderstanding their specific needs is crucial for responsible ownership. Their reliance on water is\nparamount to their survival. Therefore, what happens if you put an axolotl out of water? The answer is\nalways negative.\nThe Importance of Water for Axolotl Survival\nAxolotls are entirely dependent on water for several critical functions:\nRespiration: Axolotls breathe primarily through their external gills, which extract oxygen from the water.\nThey can also absorb some oxygen through their skin and use rudimentary lungs, but these are\nsecondary respiratory mechanisms. Outside of water, the gills collapse, and the skin dries out, severely\nimpairing their ability to breathe.\nAxolotls breathe primarily through their external gills, which extract oxygen from the water. They can\nalso absorb some oxygen through their skin and use rudimentary lungs, but these are secondary\nrespiratory mechanisms. Outside of water, the gills collapse, and the skin dries out, severely impairing\ntheir ability to breathe. Hydration: Amphibians have permeable skin, which allows them to absorb\nwater. This permeability also makes them vulnerable to dehydration in dry environments. Axolotls,\nlacking the protective scales of fish or the waterproof skin of reptiles, lose water rapidly when exposed\nto air.\nAmphibians have permeable skin, which allows them to absorb water. This permeability also makes\nthem vulnerable to dehydration in dry environments. Axolotls, lacking the protective scales of fish or the\nwaterproof skin of reptiles, lose water rapidly when exposed to air. Buoyancy and Movement: While\naxolotls can sometimes be seen walking along the bottom of their tank, they are primarily adapted for\nswimming. Water provides buoyancy, supporting their body and allowing them to move efficiently. On\nland, their limbs are not strong enough to support their weight for extended periods, leading to stress\nand potential injury.\nWhile axolotls can sometimes be seen walking along the bottom of their tank, they are primarily\nadapted for swimming. Water provides buoyancy, supporting their body and allowing them to move\nefficiently. On land, their limbs are not strong enough to support their weight for extended periods,\nleading to stress and potential injury. Waste Removal: Axolotls excrete waste products, such as\nammonia, directly into the water. Without water, these toxins can build up in their bodies, leading to\npoisoning and death.\nThe Physiological Effects of Exposure to Air\nWhen an axolotl is removed from water, a cascade of negative physiological effects begins almost\nimmediately.\nDehydration: The most immediate consequence is dehydration. The axolotl’s skin loses moisture\nrapidly, leading to a decrease in blood volume and disruption of electrolyte balance.\nThe most immediate consequence is dehydration. The axolotl’s skin loses moisture rapidly, leading to a\ndecrease in blood volume and disruption of electrolyte balance.

Monitor Water Parameters: Regularly test the water for ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels.\nWhat happens if you put an axolotl out of water? – Summary: The Dire Consequences\nTo reiterate the initial point, what happens if you put an axolotl out of water? The consequences are\nalmost always fatal without immediate intervention. Dehydration, suffocation, and a fatal buildup of\nwaste products quickly overwhelm these aquatic creatures.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nCan axolotls breathe air?\nAxolotls can use their rudimentary lungs to take in air, but this is not their primary method of respiration.\nTheir lungs are not well-developed, and they rely heavily on their gills and skin for oxygen absorption.\nTherefore, they cannot survive for long periods in air.\nDo axolotls need to come up for air?\nNo, axolotls do not need to come up for air in a healthy, properly oxygenated tank. If an axolotl is\nfrequently coming to the surface to gulp air, it could be a sign of low oxygen levels in the water,\nindicating a need for a water change or improved aeration.\nHow long can an axolotl be out of water before it dies?\nAs mentioned earlier, an axolotl’s survival time out of water is very limited, typically minutes to a few\nhours depending on environmental conditions and the axolotl’s health. Immediate re-immersion in\nclean, dechlorinated water is critical for survival.\nWhat are the signs of dehydration in an axolotl?\nSigns of dehydration in an axolotl can include pale skin, lethargy, shriveled gills, and a general lack of\nactivity. If you suspect your axolotl is dehydrated, immediately return it to clean, dechlorinated water.\nCan I take my axolotl out of the tank for short periods?\nIt’s best to minimize the amount of time your axolotl spends out of the water. If you need to move it, use\na net or container to keep it submerged as much as possible.\nIs it safe to handle an axolotl with my bare hands?\nWhile you can handle an axolotl with your bare hands, it is important to wash your hands thoroughly\nbeforehand to remove any soaps, lotions, or other chemicals that could be harmful. Handle them gently\nto avoid damaging their delicate skin and never remove their protective slime coat.\nWhat is the best way to transport an axolotl?\nThe best way to transport an axolotl is in a container filled with clean, dechlorinated water. Ensure the\ncontainer is secure and that the water temperature is similar to the tank water. Keep the transport time\nas short as possible.\nWhat should I do if I accidentally drop my axolotl out of water?\nIf you accidentally drop your axolotl out of water, immediately return it to the tank. Monitor it closely for\nany signs of stress or injury. If you notice any problems, consult a veterinarian experienced with\namphibians.\nCan axolotls live in shallow water?\nAxolotls can live in shallow water, as long as the water is deep enough for them to fully submerge and\nmove around comfortably. Ensure there is enough water to maintain stable water parameters and\nprovide adequate oxygenation.\nAre there any medical conditions that make axolotls more susceptible to dehydration?\nYes, certain medical conditions, such as bacterial or fungal infections, can compromise the skin’s\nbarrier function, making axolotls more susceptible to dehydration. Additionally, stress-induced immune\nsuppression can further exacerbate these risks.\nWhat kind of water is best for axolotls?\nAxolotls require clean, dechlorinated water with a neutral pH (around 7.0-7.5).

This study aimed to produce and optimize IAA synthesis by a fungal\nisolate obtained from rhizosphere soils in Egypt. Twenty fu…\n\nIsolation of IAA-producing fungi\nFour soil samples were collected from cultivated fields in Qalyubia Governorate, Egypt, and transported\nto the laboratory in sterile plastic bags under cooling conditions. Samples were stored at 6 °C until\nprocessing. Fungi were isolated using Potato Sucrose Agar (PSA), and plates were incubated for 7\ndays at 25 ± 2 °C. Emerging colonies were purified by repeated subculturing onto fresh PSA plates.\nPure isolates were maintained on PSA slants at 4 ± 1 °C for subsequent analyses27.\nScreening for IAA production\nScreening for IAA production was performed using Czapek’s Dox liquid medium supplemented with 0.2\ng/L L-tryptophan. The medium contained (g/L): glucose (30), NaNO■ (3), MgSO■·7 H■O (0.5),\nKH■PO■ (1.0), yeast extract (5.0), FeSO■·7 H■O (0.01), KCl (0.5), and L-tryptophan (0.2). The pH\nwas adjusted to 5.0 prior to autoclaving at 121 °C for 20 min. Two 6-mm discs of each isolate were\ninoculated into 50 mL of production medium and incubated at 25 ± 2 °C on a rotary shaker (150 rpm)\nfor 8 days. All experiments were conducted in triplicate28.\nExtraction of IAA\nAt the end of incubation, cultures were filtered through Whatman No. 113 filter paper, followed by\nmembrane filtration through a 0.22 µm filter to obtain cell-free supernatants. Fungal biomass was\nwashed, dried at 60 °C, and weighed to determine dry weight. IAA was extracted from supernatants\nusing two volumes of ethyl acetate. Organic layers were evaporated using a rotary evaporator, and the\nresidue was stored for subsequent analyses29.\nQuantification of IAA\nIAA concentrations were first quantified using the Salkowski colorimetric assay30. One milliliter of\nsupernatant was mixed with 2 mL of Salkowski reagent and incubated in the dark for 30 min at room\ntemperature. Absorbance was measured at 530 nm and compared with a standard IAA calibration\ncurve.Confirmation of IAA identity was performed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)\nusing an Agilent ChemStation system equipped with an RP-C18 column (250 mm × 4 mm, 5 µm). The\nmobile phase consisted of acetic acid: water: acetonitrile (1:15:85, v/v), with a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min.\nDetection was conducted at 254 nm, and peak areas were compared with authentic IAA standards\n(Sigma, USA)31.\nQualitative detection of Mycotoxins using Thin-Layer chromatography (TLC)\nCulture extracts were screened for mycotoxin production using thin-layer chromatography following the\nmethod of Chatterjee et al.32. Analyses were performed at the Animal Health Research Institute,\nAgricultural Research Center, Egypt.\nMorphological and molecular identification of the IAA-producing isolate\nMorphological identification was performed using slide culture preparations following the method of\nBooth33, Slides were examined under a Zeiss Axiostar Plus Trinocular Microscope at 1000×\nmagnification and photographed using a PowerShot G6 digital camera (Canon, Japan). For scanning\nelectron microscopy (SEM), fungal mycelia were carefully harvested and fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde\nprepared in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) for 12 hours at 4°C. The samples were then washed three\ntimes with the same buffer and dehydrated through an ethanol for 10–15 minutes. The dehydrated\nsamples were air-dried, mounted onto aluminum stubs using double-sided conductive carbon tape, and\nsputter-coated with a thin layer of gold to enhance conductivity34. The prepared specimens were\nsubsequently examined using a JEOL JSM-5300LV scanning electron microscope at 7500×\nmagnification. Identification was further supported by comparison with the Pictorial Atlas of Soil and\nSeed Fungi.”\nFor molecular identification, genomic DNA was extracted from 4-day-old cultures grown in Czapek’s\nDox medium according to Sharma et al.35. The extracted genomic DNA met the quality requirements\nfor downstream PCR amplification, showing an A260/280 ratio within the acceptable purity range\n(1.8–2.0) and a measurable concentration sufficient for ITS amplification, as determined using a\nNanoDrop spectrophotometer. The ITS region was amplified using primers ITS1\n(5′-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3′) and ITS4 (5′-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3′). PCR conditions\nincluded initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min; 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C\nfor 90 s; followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. Purified amplicons were sequenced using the\nPRISM BigDye Terminator v3.1 Kit and analyzed on an ABI Prism 3730XL DNA Analyzer. Sequences\nwere compared with NCBI BLAST, and phylogenetic relationships were inferred. The sequence was\ndeposited in GenBank and assigned an accession number.\nOptimization of cultural conditions for IAA production\nOptimization was carried out using one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) experiments. Cultures were incubated\nin 250 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 mL of Czapek’s Dox medium supplemented with\nL-tryptophan and maintained at 150 rpm under continuous light. After incubation, IAA concentration,\nfungal biomass, and productivity were determined for all treatments.\nEffect of L-tryptophan concentration\nL-tryptophan levels of 0.1–1.5% were tested. Media were adjusted to pH 5.0 and incubated at 25 ± 2 °C\nfor 8 days.\nEffect of incubation temperature\nCultures were incubated at 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 °C for 8 days.\nEffect of initial pH\nThe medium pH was adjusted to 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 prior to sterilization, and cultures were incubated for 8\ndays.\nEffect of incubation period\nIncubation periods ranging from 6 to 18 days were evaluated to determine the optimum harvest time.\nEffect of inoculum size\nDifferent inoculum sizes (1–5 mycelial discs, 6 mm each) were tested to determine the optimal biomass\nfor maximum IAA synthesis.\nScreening of agro-industrial wastes for IAA production\nTo identify a low-cost substrate for scalable IAA production, six agro-industrial residues—sweet whey,\nbanana peels, orange peels, wheat straw, wheat bran, and sugarcane bagasse—were screened. Solid\nsubstrates were washed, air-dried, oven-dried at 60 °C to constant weight, milled, and sieved to obtain\na homogeneous particle size of ~ 2 mm. Fermentation media were prepared by supplementing the\ndefined basal salts medium (see Sect. 2.1) with 5% (w/v) of each substrate. A medium containing only\nbasal salts served as the negative control. The concentration of 5% was chosen based on preliminary\ntrials and literature data, providing sufficient nutrients for fungal growth without inhibitory effects. A\nstandardized spore inoculum of F. oxysporum AUMC 16,438 was prepared as described in Sect. 2.2.\nFlasks containing 100 mL of production medium were inoculated with 5% (v/v) of the spore suspension\n(4.2 × 10■ spores/mL). Cultures were incubated at 30 °C with agitation at 150 rpm for 12 days. All\nconditions were tested in triplicate as independent biological replicates. After fermentation, cultures\nwere vacuum-filtered. The mycelial biomass was washed, oven-dried at 70 °C, and weighed to\ndetermine dry cell weight (DCW). The cell-free filtrate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the\nsupernatant was stored at − 20 °C until analysis. IAA concentration was determined as previously\ndescribed. IAA yield (mg/L) and specific productivity (mg IAA per g DCW per day) were calculated to\nevaluate substrate performance.\nApplication of fungal IAA in wheat seed germination\nWheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was selected as the test plant due to its global agronomic importance,\nwell-documented sensitivity to auxins, and frequent use as a model cereal crop in seed germination\nand biofertilizer evaluation studies. The bioactivity of fungal-derived IAA was assessed using the\nstandard blotter method36. Wheat seeds were surface-sterilized in 0.1% HgCl■ for 5 min, rinsed\nthoroughly with sterile distilled water (3–5 washes), and air-dried under aseptic conditions. Seeds were\nthen soaked for 6 h in fungal IAA solutions at three concentrations (25, 50, and 100 µg/mL), which were\nselected based on preliminary trials and literature reports to cover a range of biologically relevant\ndoses. To specifically attribute observed growth effects to IAA, the study included two types of controls:\n(i) seeds soaked in sterile distilled water (negative control) to account for baseline growth without\nexogenous auxin, and (ii) seeds treated with commercially available IAA at 50 µg/mL (positive control)\nto confirm that growth responses were consistent with IAA activity36,37. This design allows distinction\nbetween effects caused by IAA versus other metabolites potentially present in fungal culture filtrates.\nFor each treatment and control, 30 seeds were used, arranged as three independent biological\nreplicates of 10 seeds each. Seeds were placed on moistened sterile blotter papers in Petri dishes and\nincubated at 25 ± 2 °C for 5 days. Germination percentage, root length, shoot length, fresh and dry\nbiomass, and seed vigor index (SVI) were determined following the method of Abdul-Baki and\nAnderson38. All experiments were performed in triplicate to ensure reproducibility, and data from\nindependent biological replicates were analyzed to account for variability and strengthen the statistical\nvalidity of the results.\nStatistical analysis\nData were analyzed using SAS software. Results are expressed as mean ± standard deviation of\ntriplicate measurements. Treatment means were compared using Duncan’s multiple range test at a\n95% confidence level (p ≤ 0.05)39."}

Applying chemicals like Sniper to\nhttps://punchng.com/using-insecticides-for-lice-dandruff-can-kill-doctors-tell-nigerians/\n\nHealth experts have warned that applying insecticides such as Sniper to the hair or scalp to treat lice or\ndandruff can lead to severe poisoning, coma and death, stressing that the chemical is highly toxic and\nunsafe for skin contact.\nThey said the practice, which has gained traction through word of mouth and social media, exposes\nusers to life-threatening health risks within a short time of contact.\nIn exclusive interviews with PUNCH Healthwise, the doctors explained that Sniper contains dichlorvos,\nan organophosphate pesticide that can be absorbed through the skin and interfere with the nervous\nsystem, causing uncontrolled nerve activity and organ failure.\nThey noted that exposure could trigger symptoms ranging from nausea and breathing difficulties to\nseizures, loss of consciousness and sudden death.\nThe experts further noted that there is no medical evidence supporting the use of Sniper for dandruff or\nhair lice, describing such claims as dangerous misinformation. They added that dandruff is a fungal or\ninflammatory scalp condition that requires proper medical treatment, not toxic chemicals meant for\nagricultural or industrial use.\nChildren and people with underlying conditions such as asthma, the doctors noted, are particularly\nvulnerable, warning that repeated or prolonged exposure increases the risk of long-term damage,\nincluding nerve injury, organ failure and possible cancer.\nThe experts’ warning comes amid a recent post on X, formerly Twitter, by a user, Serah Ibrahim, who\ncautioned Nigerians against using the pesticide on their hair for lice or dandruff.\nResponding to the post, a public health physician, Dr Babatunde Adewumi, recounted a case in which a\nman applied a Sniper on his children’s bodies to ward off soldier ants, leading to the death of three of\nthem from poisoning.\nThe tweet read, “It can be absorbed via the skin and kill. This happened when a man put a sniper on his\nchildren’s bodies to ward off the soldier ants that infested his house. The first child presented, and I was\ncalled to assess for VHF. It was at this point in history that he mentioned that he used a sniper on his\nchildren’s bodies; he lost three of his children because of the poisoning.”\nThe National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control had, in 2019, expressed concern\nabout the use and misuse of Sniper insecticide and other brands of agricultural formulations of\nDichlorovos and warned the public to desist from using them as household insecticides, as such\nmalpractice is associated with public health hazards.\nIn 2025, after a PUNCH Healthwise report, the agency warned traders against using the products to\nsafeguard food from spoilage.\nDespite warnings, Nigerians continue to use pesticides for practices they were not meant or designed\nfor.\nSpeaking further with PUNCH Healthwise on the dangers, Adewumi, who is also the founder of Quinta\nHealth, said using Sniper on the hair or skin was extremely dangerous and could be fatal.\nHe explained, “Using Sniper insecticide on human hair or skin is extremely dangerous and can be fatal.\nIt contains dichlorvos (DDVP), an organophosphate pesticide that is strictly intended for agricultural or\nindustrial use and is often banned for household use due to its high toxicity. Applying it to the head for\nlice or dandruff can lead to severe systemic poisoning, respiratory failure, and death.”\nThe public health physician explained that dichlorvos works by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, an\nenzyme essential for normal nerve function, causing nerves to fire continuously and resulting in\nrespiratory failure and organ shutdown.\nAdewumi stated, “Sniper inhibits acetylcholinesterase in the nervous system, which can cause nerves\nto fire erratically, leading to organ overactivity and organ failure. There is no medical evidence that it’s\nan effective cure for dandruff, which is typically a fungal or inflammatory scalp condition.”\nHe added that the chemical strips the scalp of its natural oils, leading to severe dryness, skin damage\nand possible permanent scarring, whilst offering no cure for dandruff.\nThe physician said, “These harsh chemicals strip natural oils, leading to extreme dryness, brittleness,\nand potential permanent scarring of the skin.”\nAdewumi identified several risks faced by people who apply Sniper to their hair or skin, including acute\npoisoning with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, sweating, blurred vision and excessive\ntearing.\nThe public health expert further noted that exposure could lead to neurological and respiratory crises.\nHe explained, “Exposure can lead to muscle twitching, tremors, seizures, coma, and life-threatening\nrespiratory failure. Fatality: There are documented cases of deaths resulting from using Sniper on the\nscalp, including instances where children died after their hair was treated with the insecticide on the\nadvice of others.”\nAdewumi warned that long-term exposure to the chemicals was linked to cancer, liver damage, nerve\ndamage, and reproductive disorders.\nThe physician further decried the practice, stating that it was fuelled by home remedy advice shared on\nsocial media or by word of mouth from hair stylists or peers who might not understand the chemical’s\nlethality.\nAlso speaking, an Internal Medicine physician, Dr Ebenezer Popoola, warned that many users might\nnot immediately link their symptoms to Sniper exposure, as early signs such as headache, nausea and\nscalp irritation could appear mild.\nHe said, “The first thing is that there’s already an abuse of this, and people who are using it are using it\nfrom the level of ignorance that they are operating in, and therefore that in itself is dangerous. From a\nmedical perspective, the symptoms can be very subtle. People may experience things they wouldn’t\nimmediately associate with it, such as headaches or nausea.”\nPopoola noted that more obvious symptoms included scalp irritation beyond the hair loss users were\nexperiencing, as well as eye irritation.\nThe internal medicine expert said worsening asthma, breathing difficulty, muscle twitching, seizures\nand coma could develop with continued exposure, adding that the chemical could damage multiple\norgans, including the brain and kidneys.\nAddressing why people engage in the dangerous practice, Popoola attributed the practice to\nmisinformation, cultural habits and poor access to proper healthcare.\nHe said, “The first thing here is that it is a cultural or community practice. Oftentimes in the Nigerian\nsetting, we have found out that people tend to take medical advice based on people’s experience rather\nthan going to the hospital for specialist advice. So when they feel like somebody else has used it, then it\nbecomes a norm in the society, in the community.”\nThe physician noted that misinformation played a significant role in the practice, as users did not\nunderstand that the chemical was deadening cells around the application area.\nPopoola explained, “What the chemical is doing is beyond what they can imagine. It’s deadening the\ncells around that place, so in a way, because it’s deadening that cell, they see it as, it’s actually curing\nthe problem, so it’s more like you want to kill a cockroach, and you’re using a sledgehammer, it will still\ndie, but the environment around that place will feel the impact of the sledgehammer.”\nHe identified lack of access to proper treatment as another reason people resorted to using the\ninsecticide, though he noted that in many cases, people chose not to seek proper medical care despite\nhaving access.\nAdvising people who use the insecticide, Popoola urged immediate discontinuation once they became\naware of its dangers and urged people to seek medical attention if they had been exposed.\nThe physician advised people experiencing symptoms to visit a hospital for further evaluation to assess\nhow far their organs had been affected.\nPopoola explained that specialists would place affected individuals on special medication or\nrecommend lifestyle modifications necessary to reverse or halt the progress of complications.\nThe internal medicine expert urged individuals who had been affected by harmful advice to help\neducate members of their communities, in order to prevent others from engaging in the practice."}

These initial pat…\n\nIn China, an expanding number of large-scale, disease-specific, multi-year follow-up clinical cohorts,\nfunded by national research grants, have been instituted. These include ones for diabetes (4C,\nBPROAD), obesity (GOCY), metabolic diseases (China-Map), Alzheimer’s disease (China HEAD\nStudy) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), to name a few. While these cohort studies provide\nepidemiological insights to help shape government healthcare policy decisions, they are also proving\ninvaluable to innovative drug development.\nOne prominent example of a cohort study is the China National Stroke Registry 3 (CNSR3)7. This\ncohort includes 15,000 patients who have had a stroke from 210 clinical centers throughout the country,\nwith data covering clinical, bloodwork, brain imaging and behavioral evaluations collected at 3-month,\n6-month and years 1–5 annual intervals. Additionally, all participants have their whole-genome\nsequencing and blood proteomics data collected8. Analyses of the dataset may not only shed light on\nmechanisms of stroke pathogenesis and prognosis but also help develop therapeutic strategies for\ndisease prevention and treatment. Preliminary efforts have already identified drug targets, from which\ndrug molecules are under development (for example, patent CN114685449B; ref. 9). A ‘reverse\ntranslation’ model has been put forward in which novel targets for stroke therapy identified by the\ngenotype–phenotype relationship studies of STROMICS8 are validated by cell and animal research in\nthe laboratory, and new drug candidates generated will then be tested in clinic trials. Biopharmaceutical\ndrug developers increasingly favor this human data-based drug discovery over animal research.\nCohort studies may identify patient subtypes on the basis of their association with genetic variants and\ntherefore help to develop patient stratification strategies for clinical trials. The CNSR3/STROMICS\nstudy has identified at least five subtypes of ischemic stroke, and genetic variations at certain targets\nmay selectively be associated with a particular subtype. New biomarkers for disease progression and\ndrug efficacy can also be developed by careful examination of genotype–phenotype associations\n(blood proteins, imaging data and so on).\nFinally, cohort studies can be adapted and converted to form ‘trial-ready cohorts’ (TRCs) that simplify\npatient enrollment and reduce time and costs. One example is the ALS TRC, developed at Peking\nUniversity Third Hospital, which has approximately 1,500 patients10. The study has systemically\ncollected and recorded family history, sleep, cognitive and behavioral assessment, first symptom\n(onset) time and clinical diagnosis, treatment and disease progression, and disease- or\ntreatment-related biomarkers. Many of the patients have imaging (CT or MRI), electromyogram and\nwhole-genome sequencing data recorded. Participants were recruited, not by traditional advertising or\nthrough contract research organizations (CROs), but by contacting and obtaining consent from specific\npatients within the TRC who fit the inclusion and exclusion criteria of a specific trial. This expedites\npatient enrollment with high quality and limited cost.\nPatient recruitment is facilitated by ‘trial-ready datasets’ (TRD), owned and operated by public health\nagencies. Shanghai Hospital Development Center (SHDC), which is responsible for the performance\nevaluation, investment and data management of all municipal public hospitals in Shanghai, is now\ndeveloping TRDs. SHDC issues standards for data collection and collects and manages all data (for\nexample, clinical, imaging and pathology) on a daily basis. To promote translational and clinical\nresearch, SHDC has systematically organized TRDs for major diseases and makes them available\nthrough the ‘one-stop’ Clinical Cohort Data Sharing System to drive faster, highly targeted recruitment."}

He\nwill report to West Palm Beach, Fla., in two weeks healthy and ready to compete. “I feel ahead of\nschedule right now instead of behind,” Arrighetti said on Saturday at FanFest at Daikin Park. “So I’m\njust really optimistic going into camp that I’ll be able to hit the ground running, be on par with the rest of\nthe group and just still be in that competition fighting for my spot.”\n The team hopes Zach Cole can be an outfield regular.\nThe potential for a full season from Alvarez could help. So would contributions from rookie outfielder\nZach Cole. Without being prompted, team officials have praised Cole all offseason and hope he can\ncarve out a regular role in Houston’s unsettled outfield.\nI have my doubts. Last season in 52 PA, he posted a 61% Contact%. In the most recent edition of The\nProcess, I found that best case outcome for someone with so much swing-and-miss is about 250 PA.\nAthletics\n Nick Kurtz is preparing his body for a full 162-game schedule.\nIn preparing for Year 2, Kurtz is focused on getting his body ready for the grind of a 162-game season.\nHe has tried to balance his offseason workouts between getting stronger in the weight room while also\ndropping a few pounds for better mobility and to, hopefully, avoid the tired legs he felt toward the end of\n2025. “I know what needs to be done to stay healthy for 162 [games],” Kurtz said, “what I need to do\nwith my body in the weight room and eating-wise to kind of not hit that wall at some point throughout the\nyear. I know 162 is a lot of games. I want to do the best I can to play every single one of them.”\nOrioles\n Heston Kjerstad will be ready for Spring Training …\nOrioles manager Craig Albernaz says outfielder Heston Kjerstad (undisclosed) is expected to be a “full\nparticipant” in spring training. — Matt Weyrich (@ByMattWeyrich) January 23, 2026\n… after dealing with fatigue last season.\nThere hasn’t been a clear explanation for the outfielder’s absence to end last season, but it appears to\nbe in the rearview. Kjerstad was shut down in late July while dealing with fatigue. Reports in September\nwere that he was seeing doctors about an unspecified medical condition.\nRoyals\n Isaac Collins could get reps at second base.\nWe’ll see Collins in left field the majority of the time, while Thomas will move among all three spots. The\nRoyals touted Collins’ ability to play second base when they acquired him, giving them flexibility, so it’ll\nbe interesting to see whether he gets reps there this spring.\nTwins\n The plan is for Ryan Jeffers to be the starting catcher for 100 games.\nAt first glance, the Caratini signing would seem to make Jeffers, a free agent next winter, a possible\ntrade candidate. Jeffers suggests that management indicated otherwise to him. “Before all that\nhappened, I had conversations [with management telling me] ’Hey, this might happen,’ and just\nreassuring me that my role as the guy who’s going to catch 100-plus games is not going to change,”\nJeffers told host John Vittas. I’m excited to go back there and really get a full season in. Throughout my\ncareer, I’ve split time with a lot of guys, and I’m excited to catch a full workload and also be joined by a\nguy (Caratini) who’s been in the game for eight-plus years and has a lot of experience, has won a lot of\ngames and has been with some organizations that have played really good baseball.”\n David Festa is almost going through a normal offseason.\nRight-hander David Festa has been encouraged by his offseason progress. He made only one\nappearance, in Triple-A, after July 21 due to a mild form of thoracic outlet syndrome. That diagnosis is\noften scary for pitchers, and it was initially for Festa. But he said on Saturday that he’s going through\nsomething very close to a normal offseason, and he expects to be ready to compete for a rotation spot\nwhen camp opens next month.\n Pablo López went through a normal offseason.\nPablo López said his health has not been a concern and that he has had a “normal” offseason following\na late-season right forearm injury.\n Bailey Ober admitted that his hip bothered him all of last season.\nOber explained that the main trouble that bothered him was discomfort in the hip of his landing leg.\nThat led to inconsistency in his delivery, since he never knew whether he’d fully have his leg under him\nwhen he landed. He pitched through it, effectively at times, early in the year. But all the while he was\nfalling into bad habits. So although he was mostly feeling OK physically when he returned from the\ninjured list, his mechanics remained out of whack. “I just never felt like I had a stable base throwing,”\nOber said. “It felt like my release was off almost every single throw. Sometimes I’d have 10 throws in a\nrow where it felt great, and the next 10 are like, ‘I don’t know where this is going.’ It was a sharp pain,\nand I didn’t feel strong in my front leg to block.” The challenge was knowing when to try to pitch through\nit and when to pack it in. With some hindsight, Ober acknowledges he might handle things differently if\nhe had another opportunity.\nNational League\nCubs\n Matt Shaw is taking reps in the outfield.\nAfter batting practice, Matt Shaw took outfield reps. Good reaction time from crack of bat, one depth\njudgment misread on a fly ball at him, but great acceleration going back and forward. Lots of torque and\nhorsepower in his running. VIDEO. pic.twitter.com/qP6NQ2XWon — John Antonoff (@baseballinfocus)\nJanuary 21, 2026\n Justin Steele won’t be ready for the start of the season, but he feels he’s ahead of schedule.\n“There hasn’t really been any hiccups at all through this process,” Steele said. “It’s felt good the entire\ntime. If anything, we’re ahead of schedule. I’ve kind of been pushing the envelope the entire time,\nwanting to get off the mound.” While Steele added that “it’s full steam ahead,” that does not mean there\nare any firm dates circled for a potential comeback yet. Opening Day has already been ruled out\npublicly by manager Craig Counsell, who said during the Winter Meetings that the first half was\npossible for the lefty’s return, barring any setbacks.\nDiamondbacks\n Ryne Nelson is preparing to make 30 starts while working on his slider and curve.\nNelson made getting physically stronger a priority this offseason so he can handle the rigors of making\n30 or more starts in 2026. With that in mind, he’s added some muscle and reduced some body fat. He\nworked on continuing to develop his slider — which he thought he made big strides with in 2025 — and\nhis curveball. The goal is that when he throws those pitches, he’s not just throwing them because he\nneeds to, but because he believes and trusts in them.\nLast season, he threw his slider 12% of the time and curve 11% of the time. Our STUPH models have\nthe slider (14% SwStr%) as an average pitch and the curve (12% SwStr%) as below average.\nDodgers\n Odds are that Tommy Edman will not be ready for Opening Day.\nConcern over Tommy Edman’s surgery recovery might have given the Dodgers more incentive to land\nTucker. Edman will be delayed in starting the spring as he recovers from a right ankle operation. There\nis a growing likelihood he will not be ready for Opening Day.\nGiants\n Bryce Eldridge is about done with the rehab on his wrist.\nEldridge underwent postseason surgery to address a bone spur in his left wrist. He said he’s essentially\nat full strength, noting that he’s in the final stages of his hitting program. Eldridge should enter camp\nhealthy as he battles for the starting first base/designated hitter job in what would be a split between the\ntwo positions with Rafael Devers.\n Casey Schmitt played through wrist pain in the second half.\nThe 26-year-old hurt his wrist when he was hit by a pitch on June 25, and he played through persistent\ndiscomfort in the second half. When the pain didn’t subside during the offseason, Schmitt decided to\nopt for the same surgery that top prospect Bryce Eldridge had in October. “I kind of dealt with it\nprobably since June or July when I got hit against Miami that first time,” Schmitt said. “I was kind of\ndealing with it since then. Just masking it and just getting through the season. I thought it would go\naway. So I gave it a month off. It didn’t go away. Then we went the surgery route to get it taken care of\nso I don’t have to deal with it for this year.”\nPhillies\n Otto Kemp will mostly play in the outfield."}

Thousands of striking workers, who are represented by\nUnited Nurses Associations of California/Union of Health Care Professionals, are expected to strike\nindefinitely amid stalled labor negotiations. (Aric Crabb/Bay Area News Group) Expand\nMore than 30,000 Kaiser Permanente health care workers started an open-ended strike early Monday\nat dozens of hospitals and hundreds of clinics in California and Hawaii.\nNorthern California physician assistants, nurse anesthetists, midwives and others represented by\nUnited Nurses Associations of California/Union of Health Care Professionals, rallied outside facilities\nstarting at 7 a.m. in Oakland, Santa Clara and Roseville.\nTheir union is calling on Kaiser, the North Bay’s largest health care provider and one its largest\nemployers, to improve staffing levels and pay. Negotiations have largely stalled amid sharp public\nsparring between the two sides.\nJennifer Van Buskirk, a Kaiser physician assistant in Santa Rosa, was among those on the picket line\nin Oakland, along with a number of colleagues. The union represents more than 120 workers in\nSonoma County who walked off the job Monday.\n“None of us wanted to be here. We were hoping it wouldn’t get to this,” said Van Buskirk who held a\n“people over profit” sign. “It’s frustrating, but we’re here because we’re standing up for our members\nand patients.”\nIn her nearly nine years at Kaiser, Van Buskirk said there’s been a shift in culture, “pressure on\nproviders to do more with less.”\nOn Monday, the turnout was strong, both from workers and other community members, Van Buskirk\nsaid. One man wore a sign that said “KP patients support KP workers.”\nIn a statement, Kaiser said “we look forward to being able to finalize new contracts for our employees\nand their families.”\nKaiser noted that the involved union represents 2,800 workers in Northern California and that hospitals,\nemergency rooms, and medical offices will remain open. In some cases, appointments are being\nshifted virtual or procedures are being rescheduled, and patients are being contacted if affected. Kaiser\nsaid staff is being onboarded or reassigned to work during the strike.\nUnion representatives said Monday that some employees are being asked to take on roles outside their\njob descriptions and training.\n“These negotiations come at a time when health care costs are rising, and millions of Americans are at\nrisk of losing access to health coverage,” Kaiser’s statement said. “This underscores our responsibility\nto deliver fair, competitive pay for employees while protecting access and affordability for our members.\nWe’re doing both.”\nUnited Nurses Associations of California/Union of Health Care Professionals moved to strike after\ncontract negotiations broke down late last year. Workers previously took to the picket lines in a similar\naction in October, billed at the time as the largest in the union’s history at the time.\nMore than seven months into bargaining, negotiations have become increasingly contentious. Union\nmembers have accused Kaiser of prioritizing executive pay and private investments while refusing to\ntap massive financial reserves amid worker concerns over fair pay and benefits and chronic staffing\nshortages.\nKaiser officials have said they’re proposing significant increases to already generous compensation for\nrank-and-file workers against a backdrop of rising costs and instability across the health care industry.\nIn December, Kaiser paused national bargaining after officials said the union threatened to release\ndamaging information if the health care giant did not agree to labor demands, which “undermined both\nparties’ ability to continue good faith bargaining,” Greg Holmes, Kaiser’s chief human resources officer,\nsaid in a Dec. 18 video. In a recently released report, the union highlighted steadily increasing patient\npremiums and detailed the company’s billions in profit and reserves and an expanding investment\nportfolio. The union responded by filing an unfair labor practice accusing Kaiser of bypassing the\nbargaining processes and delaying progress.\nThen, on Jan. 21, Kaiser sued the Alliance of Health Care Unions, seeking release from national\nbargaining obligations in favor of local-level contract negotiations, alleging the union’s “sensational”\nreport and other tactics breached their partnership agreement.\nThe United Nurses Associations of California/Union of Health Care Professionals is part of the Alliance\nof Health Care Unions, a federation of 21 local unions representing more than 60,000 Kaiser\nemployees.\nWhile Kaiser announced a return to the bargaining table over the weekend, union negotiators called it a\ndisingenuous attempt to signal to the public they’re engaging. “We went back to the table on Friday.\nThey kept us sitting, waiting in rooms all weekend and then called us to a 10 p.m. meeting Sunday with\nthe same proposal from November – the same reasons we’re out on the strike line,” said Brian Mason,\nthe union’s chief negotiator in Northern California.\n“We’re fighting to keep what the employees already have. They’re wanting to take things away,” he said\npointing to proposed cuts to 401k plans, pensions and health insurance benefits and a failure to\naddress staffing pressures. “These are all benefits that Kaiser has been giving them for years.”\nIn a statement, Kaiser confirmed “our offer has not changed. It includes the strongest compensation\npackage in our national bargaining history.”\nThat proposal would include a 21.5% wage increase over a four-year contract, with 16% frontloaded\nover the first two years, representing nearly $2 billion in new payroll costs. The union’s alternative wage\nask would add another $1 billion in costs, Kaiser said, “making health care less affordable for our\nmembers and customers.” The healthcare provider said it has also put forward a proposal to give\nemployees greater input into how patients are scheduled and tentative agreements with other unions\nstrengthen staffing by developing dashboards that give access to staffing data and create educational\nresources and toolkits for staffing committees.\n“Despite the union’s claims, this strike is about wages,” Lionel Sims, senior vice president for human\nresources at Kaiser Permanente Northern California said in a separate Jan. 25 statement. “This\nopen-ended strike by UNAC/UHCP is unnecessary when such a generous offer is on the table. The\nstrike is designed to disrupt the lives of our patients — the very people we are all here to serve.”\nArezou Mansourian, a bargaining team member and physician assistant at Kaiser in Walnut Creek\ndenied that characterization and noted that, conversely, union member demands are in large part\nfocused specifically on patient care gaps. Understaffing has caused long delays – “three months for a\nmammogram, four weeks after a fractured wrist to come in” – “that’s not thriving,” Mansourian said,\nreferencing the company’s “Thrive” tagline.\n“They’re not hiring. They’d rather keep the profit. Patients keep complaining. None of us went into\nhealth care for this,” she said. “We can’t help people because we don’t have enough time with patients\nor can’t see them in a timely manner. It’s frustrating for everyone.\n“They don’t care about the patients, and they don’t care about the employees, so at this point I ask:\nWhat does Kaiser care about?”\nMansourian was also on the picket line in Oakland Monday, like she was in October. “I think there was\na lot more people than last time,” she said. “We gave Kaiser a chance to do the right thing, and they\nhaven’t.”\nYou can reach senior reporter Marisa Endicott at 707-521-5470 or\nmarisa.endicott@pressdemocrat.com.

The ruling will remain paused while the government’s appeal plays out.\nA lawsuit filed in December alleged that federal officers violated the constitutional rights of six\nprotesters, including boxing in a civilian’s car and pointing a rifle inside. Protests have continued across\nMinneapolis, where ICE agents fatally shot Renee Good on Jan. 7 and Alex Pretti on Jan. 24. President\nDonald Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act and placed 1,500 US troops on standby to\nassist federal agents in Minnesota.\nUS District Judge Katherine Menendez said in her Jan. 16 order that the protesters had shown “an\nongoing, persistent pattern” of intimidating conduct by ICE officers. She said she could not “ignore the\nalmost-nonstop press reporting of continuing protest activity met with continuing aggressive responses\nby immigration officers operating in the Twin Cities.”\nMenendez, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, is also weighing a request by Minnesota\nstate officials for an order pausing the deployment of thousands of immigration enforcement officers in\nthe state.\nMenendez told lawyers at a hearing Monday that she was wrestling with the broad scope of the state’s\nrequest to pause Operation Metro Surge and order officers off the street while the legal fight continues.\nUS officials have “a lot of power” to carry out immigration laws, she noted.\nBut the judge also questioned the Justice Department’s assertion that the goal of the surge isn’t to force\nMinnesota to change its policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, highlighting\na disconnect between US officials’ public statements and the government’s arguments in court.\nMinnesota is alleging that the deployment of officers from ICE and other federal agencies\nunconstitutionally interferes with the state’s authority to manage its affairs and is hurting the safety and\nhealth of residents.\nThe underlying case is Tincher v.

NYC Open Data hosts hundreds of datasets covering topics such as public safety,\nhousing, transportation, education, health, and city services. While these datasets are publicly\naccessible through the Socrata API, working with them directly often requires: knowing dataset\nidentifiers,\nmanually constructing API queries,\nhandling pagination, timeouts, and rate limits,\nand performing repetitive data-cleaning steps. These barriers can slow down exploratory analysis and\nmake public data less accessible to students, researchers, and practitioners who primarily work in R.\nnycOpenData was built to remove these obstacles by providing a consistent, user-friendly interface that\nreturns clean tibbles ready for analysis—without requiring users to interact directly with the API.\nWhat does the package do? The package provides a growing collection of wrapper functions, each\ncorresponding to a specific NYC Open Data dataset or dataset family. All functions follow a shared\ndesign pattern and support: row limits,\noptional filtering via named lists,\nsorting,\nand graceful handling of API errors and timeouts. Examples of currently supported domains include:\n311 service requests\nTransportation and for-hire vehicles\nMotor vehicle collisions\nDepartment of Buildings permits and complaints\nEducation and school reporting\nJuvenile justice and public safety\nStreet trees and environmental data\nPermitted events (historical) A typical call looks like this: library(nycOpenData) nyc_311( limit = 1000,\nfilters = list(borough = \"BROOKLYN\") ) ## # A tibble: 1,000 × 40 ## unique_key created_date agency\nagency_name complaint_type descriptor ## ## 1 67613985 2026-01-26T02:06:05.… NYPD New York\nC… Noise - Resid… Banging/P… ## 2 67609553 2026-01-26T02:02:09.… NYPD New York C… Noise\n- Resid… Banging/P… ## 3 67610990 2026-01-26T01:58:58.… NYPD New York C… Illegal Parki…\nBlocked H… ## 4 67615428 2026-01-26T01:56:49.… NYPD New York C… Noise - Resid…\nBanging/P… ## 5 67609568 2026-01-26T01:48:16.… NYPD New York C… Noise - Resid… Loud\nMusi… ## 6 67612476 2026-01-26T01:47:10.… NYPD New York C… Noise - Resid… Loud Musi… ##\n7 67614152 2026-01-26T01:46:26.… DSNY Department… Snow or Ice Snow Trac… ## 8 67614054\n2026-01-26T01:44:50.… DSNY Department… Dirty Conditi… Trash ## 9 67606570\n2026-01-26T01:41:32.… NYPD New York C… Noise - Resid… Banging/P… ## 10 67610091\n2026-01-26T01:35:51.… NYPD New York C… Noise - Vehic… Car/Truck… ## # ■ 990 more rows ##\n# ■ 34 more variables: location_type , incident_zip , ## # incident_address , street_name ,\ncross_street_1 , ## # cross_street_2 , intersection_street_1 , ## # intersection_street_2 , address_type\n, city , ## # landmark , status , community_board , ## # council_district , police_precinct , bbl , borough ,\n… The result is returned as a tidy tibble of the 1,000 most recent NYC 311 requests, making it\nimmediately compatible with the tidyverse ecosystem for visualization, modeling, and reporting. Mini\nanalysis One of the strongest qualities this function has is its ability to filter based on multiple columns.\nLet’s put everything together and get a dataset of the last 1,000 311 requests from the New York Police\nDepartment in Brooklyn. # Creating the dataset brooklyn_nypd <- nyc_311(limit = 1000, filters =\nlist(agency = \"NYPD\", borough = \"BROOKLYN\")) # Calling head of our new dataset\nhead(brooklyn_nypd) ## # A tibble: 6 × 39 ## unique_key created_date agency agency_name\ncomplaint_type descriptor ## ## 1 67613985 2026-01-26T02:06:05.0… NYPD New York C… Noise -\nResid… Banging/P… ## 2 67609553 2026-01-26T02:02:09.0… NYPD New York C… Noise - Resid…\nBanging/P… ## 3 67610990 2026-01-26T01:58:58.0… NYPD New York C… Illegal Parki… Blocked\nH… ## 4 67615428 2026-01-26T01:56:49.0… NYPD New York C… Noise - Resid… Banging/P… ## 5\n67609568 2026-01-26T01:48:16.0… NYPD New York C… Noise - Resid… Loud Musi… ## 6\n67612476 2026-01-26T01:47:10.0… NYPD New York C… Noise - Resid… Loud Musi… ## # ■ 33\nmore variables: location_type , incident_zip , ## # incident_address , street_name , cross_street_1 , ##\n# cross_street_2 , intersection_street_1 , ## # intersection_street_2 , address_type , city , ## #\nlandmark , status , community_board , ## # council_district , police_precinct , bbl , borough , ## #\nx_coordinate_state_plane , y_coordinate_state_plane , … # Quick check to make sure our filtering\nworked nrow(brooklyn_nypd) ## [1] 1000 unique(brooklyn_nypd$agency) ## [1] \"NYPD\"\nunique(brooklyn_nypd$borough) ## [1] \"BROOKLYN\" We successfully created our dataset that\ncontains the 1,000 most recent requests regarding the NYPD in the borough Brooklyn. Now that we\nhave successfully pulled the data and have it in R, let’s figure out what NYC residents in Brooklyn are\ncomplaining about to the NYPD. To do this, we will create a bar graph of the complaint types. #\nVisualizing the distribution, ordered by frequency library(ggplot2) ggplot(brooklyn_nypd, aes(y =\nreorder(complaint_type, complaint_type, length))) + geom_bar(fill = \"steelblue\") + theme_minimal() +\nlabs( title = \"Most Recent NYPD 311 Complaints (Brooklyn)\", subtitle = \"Top 1,000 service requests\", x\n= \"Number of Complaints\", y = \"Type of Complaint\" ) This graph shows us not only which complaints\nwere made, but how many of each complaint were made.\nDesigned for reproducible workflows A core design principle of nycOpenData is reproducibility. Rather\nthan downloading static CSV files that can change over time or be accidentally modified, analyses can\nexplicitly document: which dataset was used,\nhow many rows were requested,\nwhich filters were applied,\nand when the data were accessed. This makes the package particularly useful for: reproducible\nresearch projects,\nclassroom assignments,\ndata journalism,\nand exploratory civic analysis. The package is also designed to be API-polite, with configurable\ntimeouts and safeguards that help prevent common failure modes when querying large public datasets.\nWho is it for? nycOpenData is intended for a broad audience, including: students learning statistics or\ndata science using real-world data,\ninstructors teaching reproducible research or applied data analysis,\nresearchers conducting exploratory or descriptive analyses,\ndata journalists and civic technologists,\nand anyone interested in working with NYC public data in R. The goal is not to abstract away the data\nitself, but to make access predictable, transparent, and easy to integrate into standard R workflows.\nAvailability The package is available on CRAN and can be installed using:\ninstall.packages(\"nycOpenData\") Development continues on GitHub, where new datasets and\nimprovements are added regularly."}

Unveiling the Secrets of Nocturnal Vision\nYes, deer’s eyes can appear to glow at night, but it’s not due to internal light emission. This\nphenomenon, known as eyes shine or eyeshine, is a result of light reflecting off a specialized structure\nin their eyes called the tapetum lucidum.\nUnderstanding Eyeshine in Deer\nThe eyeshine effect in deer, and many other nocturnal animals, is a fascinating adaptation that\nenhances their ability to see in low-light conditions. Do deer’s eyes glow at night? No, they don’t\ninherently glow, but they reflect light with remarkable efficiency. This ability plays a vital role in their\nsurvival, allowing them to navigate and evade predators in the darkness.\nThe Role of the Tapetum Lucidum\nThe tapetum lucidum is a reflective layer located behind the retina in the eyes of many animals,\nincluding deer, cats, dogs, and even some fish. Think of it as a biological mirror. When light enters the\neye and passes through the retina, some of it is absorbed by photoreceptor cells (rods and cones).\nHowever, some light photons miss these photoreceptors. The tapetum lucidum reflects this unabsorbed\nlight back through the retina, giving the photoreceptors a second chance to detect it. This effectively\nincreases the amount of light available to the retina, boosting vision in dim environments.\nColors of Eyeshine\nThe color of the eyeshine you observe can vary depending on the animal species and even the\nindividual animal’s genetics. In deer, the most common colors are:\nWhite: A bright, almost pure white reflection.\nA bright, almost pure white reflection. Yellow: A more yellowish or amber tint.\nA more yellowish or amber tint. Green: Less common, but still possible, a greenish glow.\nThe specific wavelength of light reflected by the tapetum lucidum determines the color. Factors such as\nage, diet, and overall health might subtly influence the eyeshine color as well.\nFactors Influencing Eyeshine Visibility\nSeveral factors influence how easily you can see eyeshine in deer:\nLight Source: A strong light source, such as headlights, significantly increases the visibility of the\neyeshine.\nA strong light source, such as headlights, significantly increases the visibility of the eyeshine. Angle of\nObservation: The angle at which you observe the deer’s eyes relative to the light source is crucial. A\ndirect line of sight improves visibility.\nThe angle at which you observe the deer’s eyes relative to the light source is crucial. A direct line of\nsight improves visibility. Distance: The closer you are to the deer, the brighter and more distinct the\neyeshine will appear.\nThe closer you are to the deer, the brighter and more distinct the eyeshine will appear. Environmental\nConditions: Fog, rain, or snow can scatter light and reduce the visibility of eyeshine.\nImportance of Eyeshine for Deer Survival\nThe eyeshine phenomenon, enabled by the tapetum lucidum, is a critical adaptation for deer,\ncontributing significantly to their survival in several ways:\nEnhanced Nocturnal Vision: Allows them to see better in low-light conditions, crucial for foraging and\nnavigating at night.\nAllows them to see better in low-light conditions, crucial for foraging and navigating at night.

Increased light sensitivity helps them\nspot subtle movements and shapes. Navigation: Aids in navigating through forests and fields at night,\nallowing them to find food and shelter.\nDifferences in Vision Between Deer and Humans\nDeer and humans have significant differences in their visual systems that contribute to the eyeshine\neffect. Human eyes lack a tapetum lucidum, which is why our eyes don’t produce eyeshine. Deer also\nhave a higher concentration of rod cells in their retina, which are more sensitive to low light levels.\nHumans rely more on cone cells, which provide color vision and sharpness in bright light. This\ndifference explains why deer are more adept at seeing in the dark, while humans have better color\nperception and visual acuity in daylight.\nFeature Deer Humans —————- —————————————- ——————————————-\nTapetum Lucidum Present Absent Rod Cells High concentration Lower concentration Cone Cells\nLower concentration High concentration Night Vision Excellent Poor Color Vision Limited Good\nCommon Misconceptions about Deer Eyes\nThere are several common misconceptions about do deer’s eyes glow at night? and the nature of\neyeshine. Some people believe that deer eyes emit light, which is incorrect. The eyes are simply\nreflecting light from an external source. Others think that all animals have eyeshine, but this is also\nfalse. Only animals with a tapetum lucidum exhibit this phenomenon.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWhy do deer’s eyes reflect light, but human eyes don’t?\nHuman eyes lack the tapetum lucidum, a reflective layer behind the retina found in deer and other\nnocturnal animals. This layer reflects light back through the retina, increasing the amount of light\navailable to photoreceptor cells and enhancing vision in low-light conditions. Without a tapetum\nlucidum, human eyes don’t have this reflective capability.\nWhat is the purpose of eyeshine in animals?\nThe primary purpose of eyeshine is to improve vision in low-light conditions. The tapetum lucidum\neffectively amplifies the available light, allowing animals to see better at night and detect potential\npredators or prey more easily. This adaptation is crucial for the survival of many nocturnal species.\nDo all deer have the same color of eyeshine?\nNo, the color of eyeshine can vary between individual deer and different species. Factors such as\ngenetics, age, and diet can influence the color of the reflection. While white and yellow are common in\ndeer, other colors like green are possible, albeit less frequent.\nIs eyeshine only visible at night?\nWhile eyeshine is most noticeable at night or in very low-light conditions, it can technically be observed\nduring the day under specific circumstances, such as inside a dark barn. However, the ambient light\nlevels typically make it much less apparent compared to nighttime.\nHow does eyeshine help deer avoid predators?\nEyeshine enhances a deer’s ability to detect predators in the dark. The increased light sensitivity allows\nthem to spot subtle movements and shapes that would otherwise be invisible. This early warning\nsystem gives them a better chance to escape danger.\nDoes eyeshine hurt a deer’s vision during the day?\nThe tapetum lucidum doesn’t typically harm a deer’s daytime vision. While it increases light sensitivity,\ndeer have other adaptations to manage bright light, such as constricting their pupils to reduce the\namount of light entering the eye.\nCan you tell if a deer is healthy based on its eyeshine?\nWhile eyeshine alone cannot definitively determine a deer’s health, changes in the appearance or\nintensity of the eyeshine could potentially indicate underlying health issues. Dullness or cloudiness in\nthe eyes, for example, might suggest an eye infection or other health problem. Consult a veterinarian\nfor a more accurate diagnosis.\nIs the tapetum lucidum found in all mammals?\nNo, the tapetum lucidum is not found in all mammals. It is present in many nocturnal and crepuscular\nmammals, such as deer, cats, dogs, and horses, but absent in humans, primates, and pigs. Its\npresence is strongly correlated with an animal’s need for enhanced night vision.\nWhat causes the different colors of eyeshine?\nThe specific composition and structure of the tapetum lucidum determine the color of eyeshine.\nDifferent materials within the reflective layer scatter light differently, resulting in various wavelengths\nbeing reflected back. This leads to the perceived differences in color.\nCan you photograph eyeshine?\nYes, you can photograph eyeshine using a camera with a flash or strong light source. The light from the\nflash will be reflected back by the tapetum lucidum, creating the characteristic glowing eyes effect in the\nphotograph.\nDoes the presence of eyeshine mean an animal is nocturnal?\nWhile the presence of eyeshine is strongly associated with nocturnal or crepuscular (active at dawn and\ndusk) animals, it doesn’t definitively mean an animal is exclusively nocturnal. Some animals with a\ntapetum lucidum may be active during the day as well, particularly in shaded environments.\nHow does eyeshine differ between different animal species?\nEyeshine can differ significantly between animal species in terms of color, intensity, and the specific\ntype of reflective material within the tapetum lucidum. These differences reflect the varying visual\nadaptations necessary for different ecological niches and lifestyles. The tapetum lucidum in cats, for\nexample, is often more reflective than in deer, reflecting their reliance on hunting in very low light."}

During the sit-down, Bezos declared he was “even\nmore optimistic today” about the newspaper’s future than he was when he bought it. “I’ve always\nbelieved…that democracy dies in darkness,” Bezos said, using The Post’s signature slogan, adding\nthat “certain institutions have a very important role in making sure that there is light.”\nNearly a decade later, staffers at The Post are questioning Bezos and publisher Will Lewis’\ncommitment to the health of the paper—and publicly pleading for them to change course—as they\nbrace for upwards of 100 newsroom layoffs that are expected to hit the sports, metro and foreign teams\nhardest, according to multiple people familiar with the matter. As of August, the newsroom headcount\nsat around 800 staffers. Including those anticipated newsroom cuts, as many as 300 Post employees\nacross the broader company could be impacted by the February trim-down, Status has learned.\nSpokespersons for The Post did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.\n“The newsroom is being punished for absolute incompetence from the owner and publisher,” one Post\nstaffer said.\nIt is a particularly inopportune time for Post leadership to enact broad cuts to the sports desk, which\ncould be shuttered entirely, according to multiple people familiar with the plans, with the start of the\nWinter Olympics just weeks away. On Friday, managing editor Kimi Yoshino startled sports staffers with\na memo informing them that the paper would no longer send a cohort of journalists to Italy to cover the\ngames, according to a copy of the email reviewed by Status. “We realize this decision and its timing will\nbe disappointing to many of you, so please reach out to me if you want to talk further,” Yoshino wrote in\nthe brief note.\nFurther rankling staff, much of the expense associated with covering the Olympics had already been\npaid prior to the reversal, according to two people familiar with the matter. The New York Times\nreported on Saturday that The Post had spent at least $80,000 on housing alone. If anything, that\nappears to be flushing money down the drain rather than effective cost-cutting. One Post staffer said\nthe cancellation served as a “devastating blow” for the sports team, and is being read internally as a\ndecision by leadership to avoid the poor optics of laying off staffers while they are on a reporting\nassignment abroad. As Status first reported last week, the layoffs are expected to take place in\nFebruary. The Olympic Games are scheduled for February 6-22.\nAs the sports team awaits its fate, the department is in “a state of paralysis,” the staffer said, at least\n“until it gets some clarity from management.” The person added to Status, “I’m done producing\njournalism for The Washington Post until I learn if I still have a job. I think a lot of people feel that way.”"}

The loss of grey matter in areas involved with memory and emotion might partly explain\nwhy women are generally at greater risk of dementia than men, researchers speculate. The findings\ncome from nearly 125,000 women, of whom 11,000 had MRI brain scans. In the study, published in the\njournal Psychological Medicine, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use did not appear to prevent the\ngrey matter loss.\nProf Barbara Sahakian, senior author and from Cambridge University, said: \"The brain regions where\nwe saw these differences are ones that tend to be affected by Alzheimer's disease. \"Menopause could\nmake these women vulnerable further down the line. While not the whole story, it may help explain why\nwe see almost twice as many cases of dementia in women than in men.\" The brain changes occurred\nin: an area which has a major role in learning and memory - the hippocampus\na region essential for forming memories and spatial navigation - the entorhinal cortex\na part which helps with attention and regulating emotions - the anterior cingulate cortex White matter\nand grey matter are both essential parts of the brain and spinal cord. Grey matter consists of neuronal\ncell bodies and their dendrites - short protrusions that communicate with neurons nearby. White matter\nconsists of long axons of neurons that transmit impulses to more distant regions of the brain and spinal\ncord.\nAsking for help\nAccording to guidelines for the NHS, HRT can be considered for menopausal symptoms such as sleep\nproblems and hot flushes. There is limited understanding of the effects of menopause and HRT use on\nthe brain, memory and mood, say the researchers. The study found women on HRT were more likely to\nsuffer poor mental health. But many of those already had poorer mental health before being prescribed\nthe medication. Co-researcher Dr Christelle Langley said it was important to recognise the variety of\nstruggles that can come with menopause. \"We all need to be more sensitive to not only the physical,\nbut also the mental health of women during menopause. \"There should be no embarrassment in letting\nothers know what you're going through and asking for help.\""}

She acknowledged it had\nbeen traumatic for her and her wh■nau, and that answers were sought about whether the baby’s death\ncould have been prevented.\nGroup director of operations at Health NZ Waitemat■, Brad Healey, told NZME it was “deeply sorry” it\ndid not provide the standard of care which was reasonably expected and needed.\n“We have apologised to our patient for the failings identified in the report, the ongoing distress and\nacknowledged that this apology is likely to be of limited comfort after such a tragic loss.”\nGrowth found at routine scan\nThe woman was pregnant with her second child when a routine ultrasound in January 2021 identified\nthat she had a benign growth in her uterus.\nGuidelines were that fibroids required an obstetric consultation, the HDC said.\nThe midwife assigned as the lead maternity carer said referral to the obstetric team at Waitemat■ was\ndiscussed with the woman at a routine antenatal appointment in February.\nDeputy Health and Disability Commissioner Rose Wall said several errors led to a failure to recognise\nthe extent to which the baby was at risk, and that Health NZ Waitemat■ had failed the mother and\nbaby.\nThe midwife sent a hospital referral, which included information about the uterine fibroids but entered\nthe email address incorrectly, which meant it was not received.\nThe woman was however referred for a general obstetric review because of her previous caesarean\nsection, but there was no reference to the growth found.\nWall said, despite that, as part of the appointment, it would be expected that the woman’s full history\nand scans to date would be reviewed and would provide the basis for recommendations for care in her\npregnancy.\n“The anatomy scan report documents the presence of a fibroid, and therefore that information was\navailable to the obstetrician providing the secondary consultation,” she said.\n‘Concern’ over baby’s growth\nAbout nine weeks after the routine ultrasound scan, the woman had a telephone consultation with an\nobstetric registrar at North Shore Hospital.\nThe woman told the HDC the fibroid was discussed during the consultation and that she would receive\nsome scans, but no follow-up arrangements were made, Wall said.\nShe said that from 28 weeks into her pregnancy, she had repeatedly asked the midwife to arrange an\nultrasound scan, but nothing happened until she neared full term at 37 weeks’ gestation.\nHowever, a comment in the antenatal records in May 2021 about the baby’s growth indicated concern\nat that stage, Wall said.\nA string of monitoring and assessment appointments followed.\nHospital at full capacity\nOn May 27, the woman and two other patients from North Shore Hospital arrived at Wait■kere Hospital\nfor acute assessment, where the level of patient need was already very high, Wall said.\nShe said North Shore Hospital maternity was at full capacity, but the capacity of the medical staff at\nWait■kere Hospital was not taken into consideration.\nThe on-call obstetricians at North Shore and the Wait■kere clinicians were not consulted or informed of\nthe diversion order and only became aware of it when patients started to arrive from North Shore\nHospital.\nClues in heart rate monitoring\nAfter the woman arrived at Wait■kere Hospital, a cardiotocograph (CTG) was performed which showed\na normal baseline heart rate, but Wall said it also showed early on an abrupt decrease of greater than\n15 beats per minute for more than 15 seconds, with slow recovery and no accelerations.\nThe mother said a doctor came into the room multiple times afterwards, reviewed the CTG and told her\nshe needed to be monitored for another hour.\nAnother doctor then told her that a “deep, prolonged deceleration” that was slow to recover was\nconcerning, especially because she was not in labour.\nThe doctor who had carried out the initial CTG assessment considered that it was safe for the woman\nto be discharged with a plan to review her in two days’ time, or sooner if she had continuing concerns.\nThe following day, the woman arrived at North Shore Hospital because she could not feel her baby\nmove.\nA doctor used the bedside scanning equipment and found no foetal heartbeat.\nSadly, the baby had died, Wall said.\nThe HDC’s finding did not specify the baby’s cause of death, only that there was a failure to recognise\nthat a normal-sized baby was unlikely to have low amniotic fluid volume, and it was not recognised that\nthe baby was small for its gestational age because the estimated foetal weight was plotted on the CGC\nincorrectly.\n“These errors were made by multiple staff, for which I hold Health NZ Waitemat■ responsible,” Wall\nsaid.\nChanges made since\nHealey said that since the tragic event, a series of process changes had occurred to ensure that when\nabnormal findings or urgent issues were identified, they were escalated as soon as possible.\nWall noted the changes included the introduction of a dedicated “assessment midwife” email inbox at\nWait■kere Hospital, and contingency plans were now in place for using beds at Wait■kere Hospital\nwhen North Shore Hospital was full, and vice versa.\nThe woman hoped her complaint and its outcome would serve to prevent others from having to\nexperience the “same preventable heartbreak”.\nTracy Neal is a Nelson-based Open Justice reporter at

Would you give up your bedroom to accommodate\nsomeone? Or would you ask your parents to make other arrangements?\nIn the following story, one woman finds herself in this situation, and her parents are not happy. Here’s\nwhat’s going on.\nAITA for telling my parents they couldn’t sleep in my apartment on Christmas I (f30) live with my partner\n(m30) in a 120 sqm apartment. We have a bedroom, a guest room with a large air mattress, and a sofa.\nThis would have been the first time hosting Christmas at our place, and I was really excited. I even\nbought extra decorations to make it cozy. The whole thing started because my MIL (f59) asked if we\ncould celebrate at our place. She was left by her husband this year and didn’t want to spend Christmas\nalone. The plan was: MIL, SIL, possibly a cousin from my partner’s side, my parents, and my aunt. His\nfamily lives 450 km away, mine only 50 km.\nHer mother tried to turn it around.\nWhen I told my parents (f63, m65), they immediately said, “Okay, we’ll reserve the couch then.”\nBasically, inviting themselves. At the time, I didn’t know how many people from my partner’s side would\nactually come, so I didn’t comment. Now that Christmas is close and it’s clear that three people from his\nside need to stay over, I told my mom we only have the air mattress and sofa, and asked if they could\neither drive home at night (45 min) or stay in a nearby hotel. There are plenty of options in the city. She\ndidn’t take it well. She said we “promised from the start” they could stay. She also said a hotel isn’t\npossible because my dad “can’t walk that far” (news to me) and it “wouldn’t be a real Christmas” if they\nhad to drive home and couldn’t drink wine.\nNow, her mother has come up with her own “solution” to the problem.\nI explained that the situation only became clear recently, and for a while, it wasn’t even clear if only my\nMIL would come. I also said I want to sleep in my own bed. I’ve spent the last ten years driving home\nlate after Christmas with my parents just to be in my bed and with my cats. What makes this harder: I’ve\nalways struggled to say “no” to my parents or set boundaries. When we talked about this in person two\ndays ago, my mom immediately started crying. It’s hard because I don’t want to seem selfish, but when\nI think about it later, my needs don’t feel unreasonable. After some drama, my mom said her “solution”\nis that we celebrate at their house if they can’t sleep at ours. That feels more like avoiding the conflict\nthan a solution. I’m sad because I was really looking forward to hosting our first Christmas. AITA?\nEek! There’s no wonder this whole thing has her feeling stressed out.\nLet’s check out how the readers over at Reddit feel about it all.\nAccording to this comment, she’s in the wrong.\nFor this reader, more info would be nice.\nAs this reader explains, she should’ve been honest from the start.\nShe needs to rethink this whole thing and apologize to her parents. Stringing them along was rude.\nIf you enjoyed that story, read this one about a mom who was forced to bring her three kids with her to\napply for government benefits, but ended up getting the job of her dreams."}

Some federal agents were expected to\nleave as soon as Tuesday.\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said he spoke by phone with Trump, who praised the discussion and\ndeclared that “lots of progress is being made.” Frey said he asked Trump in a phone call to end the\nimmigration enforcement surge and that Trump agreed the present situation cannot continue.\nThe mayor said some agents would soon leave and that he would keep pushing for others involved in\nOperation Metro Surge to go.\nAmong those who are expected to depart was senior Border Patrol commander Greg Bovino, a person\nfamiliar with the matter told The Associated Press. The person was not authorized to publicly discuss\ndetails of the operation and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.\nBovino has been at the center of the administration’s aggressive enforcement surge in cities\nnationwide. His departure marks a significant public shift in federal law enforcement posture amid\nmounting outrage over the fatal shooting of 37-year-old ICU nurse Alex Pretti by Border Patrol agents,\nthe second fatal shooting by federal immigration officers this month.\nBovino’s leadership of highly visible federal crackdowns, including operations that sparked mass\ndemonstrations in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and Minneapolis, has drawn fierce criticism from\nlocal officials, civil rights advocates and congressional Democrats.\nCriticism increased around Bovino in the last few days after his public defense of the Pretti shooting\nand disputed claims about the confrontation that led to his death.\nThe border czar, Tom Homan, will take charge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations in\nMinnesota. Frey said he planned to meet Homan on Tuesday.\nTrump and Democratic Gov. Tim Walz spoke in a phone call and later offered comments that were a\nmarked change from the critical statements they have exchanged in the past. Their conversation\nhappened on the same day a federal judge heard arguments in a lawsuit aimed at halting the federal\nimmigration enforcement surge in the state.\n“We, actually, seemed to be on a similar wavelength,” the president wrote in a social media post.\nWalz, in a statement, said the call was “productive” and that impartial investigations into the shootings\nwere needed. Trump said his administration was looking for “any and all” criminals the state has in their\ncustody. Walz said the state Department of Corrections honors federal requests for people in its\ncustody.\nMeanwhile, attorneys for the administration, the state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul\nappeared Monday before U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez, who is considering whether to grant\nrequests to temporarily halt the immigration operation.\nShe said the case was a priority, but in an order later Monday, she told the federal government’s\nattorneys to file an additional brief by 6 p.m. Wednesday. She told them to address, among other\nthings, the assertion by the state and cities that the purpose of Operation Metro Surge is to punish them\nfor their sanctuary laws and policies.\nLawyers for the state and the Twin Cities argued the situation on the street is so dire it requires the\ncourt to halt the federal government’s enforcement actions.\n“If this is not stopped right here, right now, I don’t think anybody who is seriously looking at this problem\ncan have much faith in how our republic is going to go in the future,” Minnesota Assistant Attorney\nGeneral Brian Carter said.\nThe judge questioned the government’s motivation behind the crackdown and expressed skepticism\nabout a letter Attorney General Pam Bondi recently sent to Walz. The letter asked the state to give the\nfederal government access to voter rolls, to turn over state Medicaid and food assistance records, and\nto repeal sanctuary policies.\n“I mean, is there no limit to what the executive can do under the guise of enforcing immigration law?”\nMenendez asked. She noted that the federal requests are the subject of litigation.\nTrump posted Monday on social media that Homan would report directly to him.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Homan would be “the main point of contact on the\nground in Minneapolis” during continued operations by federal immigration officers.\nIn court Monday, an attorney for the administration said about 2,000 Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement officers were on ground, along with at least 1,000 Border Patrol officers.\nIn another case, a different federal judge, Eric Tostrud, took under advisement a request from the\nJustice Department to lift an order he issued late Saturday blocking the Trump administration from\n“destroying or altering evidence” related to Saturday’s shooting.\nAttorneys for the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension told the judge they can’t trust the federal\ngovernment to preserve the evidence, citing the lack of cooperation the state is getting from federal\nauthorities after they said they were blocked from the scene."}

Tom Suozzi (D-LI) now says he regrets his recent vote to fund ICE as he\ndamns the agency’s “illegal and immoral conduct.”\nArgh: If the GOP declines to let the Dems single out DHS (and why should it?), the progressive party\nwill once again be shutting down a host of agencies that mainly help Democratic constituencies; they’re\nalso blocking any chance to restore at least some of the Obamacare subsidies they were demanding in\nthe last shutdown drama.\nAnd as the cool-down proceeds in Minneapolis, eventually enough moderates will quit holding\neverything up; Schumer & Co. might as well just be holding their breath ’til they turn blue.\nThe clueless left’s power has grown so strong that Democrats are going to impose suffering on their\nown people in a completely futile stand."}

Roughly a week ago, Barkley made headlines again\nwhen he revealed he’d complained about the show airing less frequently since moving to ESPN. Since\nthen, some people have weighed in on the reasons for the show having fewer broadcasts. Inside\nrecently returned the airwaves and, during that airing, Barkley dropped some choice words for the\n“fools” who’d spoken out.\nAssumptions About Inside The NBA’s Schedule Are Made By Social Media Users And A TV Host\nBefore this past Saturday, January 24, Inside the NBA last aired on Christmas Day and, prior to that, a\nnew episode of the show hadn't aired since November 12. All the while, some fans online began to\nspeculate about the lower number of broadcasts. Veteran media personality Colin Cowherd didn’t keep\nhis own thoughts a secret.Cowherd addressed the matter on his Fox Sports show, The Herd, this past\nFriday. After referencing Barkley’s complaints, Cowherd shared his thoughts on Inside’s position:\n[Charles] wishes he’d work more, and my feeling is — this is just conjecture — is that ESPN has a great\nrelationship with the NBA, and they said, ‘Yeah, we’ll bring that show over. You won’t see it as much.’\nPut it on the shelf a little bit. Because Adam Silver…\nThe assertion from Cowherd suggests that the National Basketball Association worked with Disney's\nflagship sports network to push Inside to the side for a bit. So, if that were true, why would that have\nhappened? Well, Cowherd dropped more reasons for why he thinks Inside has been “buried”:\nIt felt very, very big at one time and, now, it’s invisible, so I don’t know. I’m just saying conjecture, but I\nknow there were people upstairs in the NBA office that didn’t like how [Inside] lampooned the league\nand some of the players…. I would say people upstairs didn’t love sometimes — they would say, ‘NFL\nshows don’t make fun of the players, why are we making fun of the players?’ …. I’m just saying,\nCharles is complaining; it feels obvious to me that — you have these new deals, and there’s a lot of\nunderstandings that don’t have to be contractual. David Stern didn’t like when people were critical of\nthe NBA either. They’re very sensitive in the NBA.\nESPN brought Inside the NBA into the fold after Warner Bros. Discovery (the parent company of TNT)\nlost the broadcast rights to the league. What should also be pointed out is that the show’s schedule was\npre-planned and announced months ago. ESPN President Burke Magnus also said the show wasn’t\nairing as much due to a provision on Turner Broadcasting/TNT’s part. Magnus has also shared the\ncompany’s intention to add more broadcasts next season. Now, though, Charles Barkley is calling out\nthe rumors.\nCharles Barkley Didn’t Hold Back When Addressing Rumors About Inside The NBA\nBy the time he was on air this weekend, “Sir Charles” was definitely aware of the chatter sparked by his\ninitial scheduling comments. He initially sought to clarify his sentiments about complaining to upper\nmanagement. While Barkley even initially said he’d enjoyed working for ESPN, he still reiterated during\nthe broadcast that “there was no reason for us to be off two months.” The basketball hall of famer then\nturned his attention to the “fools on television” who made claims about why he and his crew hadn’t been\non the air as much lately:\nThere’s some fools at home or on the internet – they’re at home now – saying that we were talking bad\nabout the players, so they made us work less. Shut the hell up! Shut the hell up. This is already\nscheduled…. These guys [are like,] ‘They’re gonna put them on the shelf, because they don’t want\nthem on TV.’ Man, y’all need to shut the hell up. This was already planned months and months ago. All\nI said was I would’ve liked to work more in [December].\nFrom there, two of Charles Barkley’s co-hosts – Kenny Smith and Ernie Johnson – emphasized the fact\nthat the show is now set to air heavily over the next few months. As part of that, the group will cover the\nNBA postseason, including the Finals. The hosts’ heightened presence for the playoffs is actually one\nof the reasons Shaquille O’Neal is cool with the new schedule.\nSo, all in all, it would seem that fans should be wise not to buy into any rumors regarding Inside the\nNBA’s schedule at ESPN. I’m still curious, however, as to how the network might make adjustments for\nthe show’s schedule next season following fan complaints. For now, though, check out Charles\nBarkley, Shaq and co. when they return yet again amid the 2026 TV schedule on Wednesday, January\n28, starting with NBA Tip-Off at 6 p.m. ET."}

All species\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhy are birds chirping outside all night instead of sleeping?\nBirds chirp outside all night primarily due to disruptions in their natural circadian rhythm. These\ndisruptions are most commonly caused by artificial light pollution, which confuses them into thinking it’s\ndaytime, and noise pollution, which requires them to sing more to be heard.\nWhat kind of birds chirp at night?\nSeveral species of birds are known to chirp at night, including robins, nightingales, song thrushes, and\nsome species of owls. The specific species will vary depending on location and the contributing factors,\nsuch as light and noise pollution.\nIs it normal for birds to chirp at night?\nWhile some birds, like owls, are naturally nocturnal, it is not typical for most diurnal bird species to chirp\nall night. It is increasingly common, but signals a disruption in their natural behaviors, influenced by\nhuman-caused environmental changes.\nHow does light pollution affect bird behavior?\nLight pollution disrupts a bird’s natural sleep-wake cycle, leading to confusion and altered behavior. It\ncan cause them to start singing earlier, continue singing through the night, and experience stress,\nexhaustion, and reduced foraging efficiency.\nCan noise pollution cause birds to sing at night?\nYes, noise pollution can contribute to birds singing at night. The presence of constant noise can force\nthem to sing more frequently and at higher volumes in an attempt to establish their territory and attract\nmates, resulting in singing during unusual hours, including the night.\nWhat can I do to help reduce nocturnal bird song?\nYou can help reduce nocturnal bird song by minimizing light and noise pollution. Use shielded outdoor\nlighting, turn off unnecessary lights, and support efforts to reduce noise in your community. These\nsimple steps can positively impact local bird populations.\nAre there any legal regulations regarding light pollution and its impact on wildlife?\nSome areas have local regulations regarding light pollution, particularly in areas near important wildlife\nhabitats. Check with your local government to see if any such regulations exist in your area and\nadvocate for stricter environmental protections.\nHow do I identify the bird species that are chirping at night?\nIdentifying bird species at night can be challenging. Using bird song identification apps can be helpful,\nas can listening closely for distinctive calls. Consulting with a local birdwatching group or ornithologist\ncan also provide valuable assistance to determine which local species are present.\nIs nocturnal bird song a sign of environmental problems?\nYes, nocturnal bird song can be a sign of environmental problems, particularly light and noise pollution.\nIt serves as an indicator of habitat disruption and the impact of human activities on wildlife populations.\nDoes nocturnal bird song affect human sleep patterns?\nYes, nocturnal bird song can disrupt human sleep patterns, particularly for those who are light sleepers\nor live in noisy urban environments. This disruption can lead to fatigue, stress, and other health\nproblems.\nWhat is the long-term impact of nocturnal bird song on bird populations?\nThe long-term impact of nocturnal bird song on bird populations is still being studied, but it is believed\nthat it could lead to decreased reproductive success, reduced survival rates, and altered migration\npatterns. This poses a significant threat to the long-term health of bird populations.\nAre certain bird species more vulnerable to the effects of nocturnal light and noise pollution?\nYes, certain bird species are more vulnerable to the effects of nocturnal light and noise pollution. Those\nspecies are generally insectivores that are more sensitive to the altered feeding habits of insects that\nare attracted to the same pollutants as humans are. The species that have more developed nocturnal\nsurvival skills can handle nocturnal conditions better."}

Latino lawmakers want more protection for\nimmigrants, urge Shapiro to end ICE collaboration\n\nants-urge-shapiro-to-end-ice-collaboration.html\n\nThe Legislative Latino Caucus is assailing federal immigration operations and is urging passage of\nlegislation to protect the safety and rights of immigrants. They urge Gov. Josh Shapiro to end\ncooperation with ICE.\n\nLeaders of the state Legislative Latino Caucus are calling on Gov. Josh Shapiro to use the “full scope\nof his executive and administrative authority” to protect immigrant communities, including ending\ncollaboration with ICE and prohibiting the sharing of sensitive personal data with federal immigration\nauthorities.\n“The Pennsylvania Legislative Latino Caucus stands in solidarity with the communities impacted by the\nongoing federal immigration enforcement surge -- including the fatal shooting of a Minneapolis resident\nby federal immigration agents, which marks the latest in a series of deadly incidents drawing national\noutrage and calls for accountability,” lawmakers said in a written statement.\nLeadership of the caucus includes chairwoman Rep. Johanny Cepeda-Freytiz of Berks County; Rep.\nJose Giral, Philadelphia County and Rep. Lindsay Powell, Allegheny County. All are Democrats.\nHouse Bill 1880 would prohibit the use of face coverings or masks by federal law enforcement officials\nin Pennsylvania.\n“We remain steadfast in advancing policies rooted in dignity, due process, and humanity, and we will\ncontinue fighting for our immigrant neighbors in the Pennsylvania General Assembly,” the legislative\ngroup said.\nThe Latino lawmakers further assailed the federal immigration enforcement in Minnesota.\n“Once again, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agents operating under this\nadministration have demonstrated a reckless disregard for human life and community safety,”\nThe group condemned the actions as not isolated — but reflecting a broader pattern of “aggressive,\nmilitarized immigration enforcement that terrorizes communities.”\n“ICE agents frequently misrepresent themselves as law enforcement and employ tactics that erode\ntrust and interfere with the work of state and local police, whose duty is to protect all Pennsylvanians,”\nthe caucus said.\n“We categorically reject the false choice between public safety and immigrant rights. True public safety\nis built through transparency, accountability, restraint, and respect for due process -- not fear,\nintimidation, or lethal force. The escalation of violence linked to federal immigration operations should\nalarm every Pennsylvanian, regardless of immigration status.”\nThe Trump administration drew widespread bipartisan condemnation after this weekend’s second fatal\nshooting of an innocent protester at the hands of ICE in Minneapolis. Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse for the\nVeterans Administration, was killed by agents on Saturday. His killing followed that of Renee Good a\nfew weeks ago. Both Pretti and Good were 37.\n“Our congressional delegation continues to be obstructed by an administration that shows little regard\nfor checks and balances or the rule of law,” the Latino lawmakers said.\nThey urged Sens. John Fetterman and Dave McCormick to vote NO on the bill that would fund the\nDepartment of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE.\nFetterman, a Democrat, on Monday broke his silence on the raging national debate, saying operations\nin Minneapolis should “stand down and immediately end.”\n“It has become an ungovernable and dangerous urban theatre for civilians and law enforcement that is\nincompatible with the American spirit,” he said in a statement.\nSen. Dave McCormick, a Republican, on Monday issued a statement saying that he supported the\ncurrent appropriations package being considered by the Senate this week. The legislation passed the\nHouse with slim bipartisan support. Seven Democrats voted in favor of the bill.\nMcCormick, his office said, does not support defunding ICE.\n“While we can debate border security and immigration enforcement policies, Senator McCormick\nopposes shutting down the government and defunding homeland security,” the statement said. “He\nencourages bipartisan cooperation and for both parties to come together, pass the remaining funding\nbills, and prevent a government shutdown before the January 30th deadline.”\nLatino lawmakers urged the state House to prioritize a slate of bills, including one that would establish\nan Office of New Pennsylvanians to coordinate statewide immigrant integration and protect newcomers’\nrights. Other bills would help crime victims secure legal status; expand driver’s license rights and\nprohibit the state police from performing immigration arrests."}

He\nhas now returned with another emotional plea, saying he is “dying in silence” and still hoping for\nreconciliation.\nThe native of Ihiala Local Government Area in Anambra State said his first three sons—Elvis\nUghelumba, Mathew Ughelumba and Calvin—were born in Italy, while his youngest son, Michael, was\nborn in Ireland. According to him, the family lived together briefly in London before marital issues led to\ntheir separation.\n“We had husband-and-wife arguments. I went to work and before I returned, she had left with the\nchildren,” Ughelumba said in a viral social media interview.\n“She only reached out in 2017 when my children needed Nigerian passports. I sent all my documents\nand bought all their flight tickets. When they stayed with me then, I never told them their mum did\nanything to me. She has muted me since he signed for a football club.”\nBassey, a product of Leicester City’s youth system, rose to prominence after joining Rangers on a free\ntransfer in July 2020. He made 65 appearances over two seasons for the Scottish giants, winning the\nScottish Premiership and the Scottish Cup.\nIn July 2022, he joined Dutch side Ajax in a deal worth €23m, the highest transfer fee in Rangers’\nhistory at the time. A year later, he signed for English Premier League club Fulham for €22m.\nThe 26-year-old made his Nigeria debut in March 2022 during the 2022 World Cup play-off against\nGhana and has since earned 43 caps, establishing himself as a dependable defender at the last two\nAfrica Cup of Nations tournaments.\nBefore breaking into senior football, Bassey was often listed under his father’s surname, Ughelumba, in\nteam sheets. However, as his career progressed, he adopted his mother’s surname and has\nconsistently credited her for supporting his journey.\n“He’s just not in my life — we lived with him, but that was when I was really young,” Bassey once said\nwhen asked about his father.\n“Since I was six, it has been mum and us boys. I knew that if I got the chance to put my name on the\nback of a shirt, I wanted it to be my mum’s name—my way of saying thank you.”\nA heartbroken Ughelumba also recounted several failed attempts to reconnect with his children since\n2020.\n“I have not seen my children for a long time,” he said.\n“During COVID in 2020, I drove all the way from London to Leicester when Calvin was playing there. I\nwasn’t looking for him because he was a footballer; I wanted to see my first son, but I didn’t have\naccess because their mother had changed everything. I didn’t have their numbers or anything.”\n“When I got to Leicester City, the club welcomed me and called Calvin. There was a name I used to call\nhim when he was small—‘Biggy’. When they called him that, he responded immediately.”\n“I spoke to him and he gave me an address. When I got there and he saw me, he called his mum and\nafterwards he changed. He got upset and told me to say whatever I wanted to say and leave. He said\nhe didn’t want to see me again and drove off.”\nUghelumba further revealed that he travelled from Italy to Abidjan during the 2023 Africa Cup of\nNations to try once more to see his son.\n“During Nigeria vs Angola, a journalist helped link me with the football federation. They gave me tickets\nand I watched the match. After that, I went to Abuja to try again, but I still didn’t see him,” he said.\n“Since then, I have been dying in silence. I don’t have any problems with my children—it’s just their\nmum that made me feel bad. Even if I am a devil, I can’t be a devil where my children are.”\nAs of the time of filing this report, the Fulham defender was yet to respond to his father’s claims."}

There’s this thing called doxing. And the safety of\nour employees is very important to us. So we’re going to keep those employees safe.”\nThe Department of Homeland Security claims that Pretti approached federal immigration officers with a\ngun, but video footage shows he was only holding a phone.\nMultiple agents pepper-sprayed Pretti and a female protester, video of the incident shows. While Pretti\nattempted to help the female protester, the agents forced him to the ground, held him down and beat\nhim. An agent pulled a gun from a holster at Pretti’s side as others restrained him, according to video\nanalyses by media outlets. Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara said Pretti was believed to have a\npermit to carry a firearm.\nAnother agent then appeared to shoot Pretti in the back at close range, while others continued to pin\nhis arms by his head. Another agent then fired additional bullets into the motionless man. At least two\nagents appeared to fire at least 10 bullets.\n“From what I see right now, this does not look like a justified shooting,” Charles Ramsey, the former\npolice commissioner of Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., told CNN. “The guy is prone on the\nsidewalk… and they’re still firing rounds into him.”\nDHS did not respond to a list of questions, including on its current use-of-force policy, how it determines\nwhether officers who shoot people are placed on leave, and whether Jonathan Ross, the agent who\nkilled Renee Good earlier this month, is currently working.\nIt is “absolutely inappropriate” for the agents who shot Pretti to be back at work, Diane Goldstein, a\nformer Redondo Beach Police Department lieutenant and the current executive director of the Law\nEnforcement Action Partnership. Administrative leave for officers who commit a shooting is necessary,\nshe said — for the well-being of the community and for the officer, as there’s a risk of experiencing\npost-traumatic stress disorder after such an incident.\nCharles Exum, a Border Patrol agent who shot Marimar Martinez in Chicago last October, was back at\nwork “within, I think, three days of the incident,” Martinez’s attorney previously told HuffPost. Text\nmessages showed Exum bragging about shooting Martinez, who survived. “I’m up for another round of\n‘fuck around and find out,’” he wrote. “I fired 5 rounds, and she had 7 holes. Put that in your book boys,”\nhe later texted.\nThe most recent use-of-force policy on the DHS website is from 2023, during the Biden administration.\nIt states that DHS law enforcement officials “may use deadly force only when necessary,” such as when\nsomeone “poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury to the [law enforcement officer] or\nto another person.”\nAt the time, the Southern Border Communities Coalition, a California-based advocacy group, described\nthe policy as “a step in the right direction,” but one that “falls short of meeting international human rights\nstandards and does not do enough to protect human life.”\nAccording to the coalition, 362 people have been killed in encounters with Customs and Border Patrol\nsince 2010. Although DHS’s use-of-force policy calls for a “use of force review council or committee,” it\nprovides little guidance on the makeup or functions of the council.\nStephen Miller, a homeland security adviser and the architect of the Trump administration’s far-right\nimmigration agenda, has suggested that DHS agents have “immunity” to use violence during\nimmigration enforcement operations.\n“You have immunity to perform your duties, and no one — no city official, no state official, no illegal\nalien, no leftist agitator or domestic insurrectionist — can prevent you from fulfilling your legal\nobligations and duties,” he said on Fox News in October — a message DHS reposted earlier this month\nafter Good was killed."}

Blatter was the latest international soccer figure to call into question the suitability\nof the US as a host country, the AP reports. He called for the boycott in a post on X that supported\ncomments made in an interview last week with the Swiss newspaper Der Bund by Mark Pieth, an\nanti-corruption expert who chaired the Independent Governance Committee's oversight of FIFA reform\na decade ago.\n\"If we consider everything we've discussed, there's only one piece of advice for fans: Stay away from\nthe USA!\" Pieth said in the interview. \"You'll see it better on TV anyway.\" Blatter, who was president of\nthe world's governing body for soccer from 1998 to 2015 before resigning during a corruption\ninvestigation, posted that Pieth was right to question \"this World Cup.\" The international soccer\ncommunity's concerns stem from Trump's expansionist posture on Greenland, travel bans, and\naggressive tactics in dealing with migrants and immigration enforcement protesters in the US. There's\nbeen talk in Europe about a boycott, per Deutsche Welle.\nOke Göttlich, one of the vice presidents of the German soccer federation, told the Hamburger\nMorgenpost newspaper in an interview on Friday that the time had come to seriously consider\nboycotting, per the AP. A Danish official said it could come to that if Trump's designs on Greenland\nresulted in conflict. Two weeks ago, travel plans for fans from two of the top soccer countries in Africa\nwere thrown into disarray when the Trump administration announced a ban that would effectively bar\npeople from Senegal and Ivory Coast from following their teams unless they already have visas. Trump\ncited \"screening and vetting deficiencies\" as the main reason for the suspensions.\nFans from Iran and Haiti, two other countries that have qualified for the World Cup, will be barred from\nentering the US as well; they were included in the first iteration of the travel ban announced by the\nTrump administration. FIFA President Gianni Infantino's alignment with Trump and presentation of an\ninaugural honor to Trump worries some in politics and soccer that the tournament could be used in\npropaganda, per DW. \"I don't know on what grounds FIFA suddenly needs to award a peace prize, but\nit could be a warning of what could await us when the tournament happens in the US,\" said Mogens\nJensen of the Danish Social Democrats. The US is co-hosting the event with Canada and Mexico from\nJune 11 to July 19."}

It's good stuff, albeit largely\nunfinished good stuff, but the updates are slowly trickling in, and I'm all about this new necromancy\ngrimoire in the latest patch.\nProgression is still a little stagnant for now as Hytale chips away at early access updates, though the\nGrimoire: Rekindle Embers is more of what I want to see, even if it feels a little underwhelming. With the\nfancy book, you can summon undead hordes to smack enemies about and take the pressure off\nyourself. Well, I say horde, but you've got a limited amount of pages to work with. At full capacity, it's\nmore like a small skeletal squad.\nYou can find the Grimoire: Rekindle Embers in Zone 4 as a drop from the Burnt Skeleton Praetorians.\nThey aren't a guaranteed drop, so maybe use those pages wisely. When I briefly tested it, the grimoire\nonly seems to work with Piles of Bones—as in the actual furniture item—and not Bone Fragments.\nThe skeleton-summoning book builds upon the necromancy feature that sent the Hytale subreddit into\na panic last week after some players assumed a few underwhelming skellies were representative of\nHytale's full magic system. Turns out that's not the case, and Hypixel CEO Simon Collins-Laflamme set\nthe record straight: \"This is just a random drop fun item, it will evolve over time.\"\nThank god for that, because the few allies I conjured up burned themselves to death before the enemy\neven bothered to attack. Simon positioned this update as another avenue for modders to play around\nand experiment with the full potential of creating in Hytale's sandbox. It makes sense to me as we saw\nplenty of Hytale mods launch on day one, and the CurseForge library already has over 3,000 mods in\nless than two weeks.\nAs for other changes in Hytale's second patch, there's a handful of new cosmetics and accessory\nvariants available for everyone, regardless of which version you own. Since they listed vampire teeth as\npart of the customization drop, I had to hop on and see what all those new additions look like.

In November 2021, the two actors confirmed they were in a\nromantic relationship, and in December 2024, they became engaged. In the midst of this, Holland and\nZendaya have continued to work together, and the latter recently opened up about what it’s like still\nprofessionally collaborating with her fiancé.\nThe 2026 movies schedule will see Tom Holland and Zendaya both starring in Spider-Man: Brand New\nDay and The Odyssey, so accounting for Spider-Man: Far From Home and Spider-Man: No Way\nHome, that means they’ve been in five movies together. While working in the same place might not be\na good arrangement for some couples, Zendaya had nothing but positive things to say about acting\nalongside Holland. As she told The Mirror:\nHonestly, I know people might think it’s awkward, he is my favourite person to work with. On set he has\nthis huge calming presence that not only puts me at ease but also everybody he works with. I might be\na little biased but he is not only my favourite person, he is my favourite person to work with.\nWell that certainly sounds like true love right there. While there might have been a scenario where\nthese two feel that it’s important to keep their professional and personal lives separate, Zendaya\nactually welcomes having Tom Holland around when they’re starring in the same movie, as he’s both a\ngreat scene partner and helps relax her. Granted, the fact that MJ is so important to Peter Parker’s\njourney in the MCU means it would be complicated to cut Zendaya out of upcoming Marvel movies, so\nit’s fortuitous that this dynamic functions so well.\nAs for why Zendaya thinks she and Tom Holland have maintained such a great professional\nrelationship in the midst of being engaged, she said that the key is balance, explaining:\nNeither of us want to hide and not live our lives and do normal things like go out for dinner, but at the\nsame time we want to protect our privacy. You have to accept that to a degree some aspects of your\nprivacy are going to be out of your control. But the parts that are in our control, we fiercely protect.\nIt’s good to hear they have this balancing act figured out, and I hope it remains steady once they’re\nmarried. Since Spider-Man: Brand New Day plot details are still being kept under wraps, it’s still unclear\nhow prominent Zendaya’s role will be in the movie after she had her memories of Peter Parker erased\nin No Way Home. As for The Odyssey, Holland stars as Telemachus, the son of Matt Damon’s\nOdysseus, and Zendaya will play Athena, the goddess of wisdom, war and handicraft. Depending on\nwhat creative liberties Christopher Nolan is taking with his adaptation of Homer’s epic poem, we may\nnot see Holland and Zendaya sharing screen time in that movie.\nThe Odyssey and Spider-Man: Brand New Day hit theaters on July 17 and July 31, respectively. That’s\nright, within just a two-week period, we’ll get a double dose of Tom Holland and Zendaya, and no doubt\nthey’ll also have some cute moments together as they’re promoting both movies."}

Photo by Al Drago/Getty Images.\nMultiple analyses of videos of the killing raise questions about the administration’s account that Pretti\n“approached” officers with a handgun, “violently resisted” an attempt to “disarm” him, and “wanted to do\nmaximum damage and massacre law enforcement.”\nWe’d caution that it’s early in the investigation and that more information should be revealed,\nparticularly about what happened before what’s shown in available bystander videos. DHS told NBC\nNews that there is body-camera video available from multiple federal agents, but those videos have not\nbeen publicly released.\nPretti, a 37-year-old man who worked as an intensive care unit nurse, had a handgun when he was\nwrestled to the ground by immigration officers. But it’s unclear when exactly officers were aware of the\nweapon and whether Pretti had shown the gun or threatened officers with it, as administration\ncomments have suggested.\nMinneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara told CBS News that Pretti “did have a permit for the handgun to\ncarry it.” In Minnesota, a permit is required to carry a gun in public, and the gun doesn’t need to be\nconcealed.\nPretti was shot and killed by Border Patrol officers shortly after 9 a.m. Central time. Media reports soon\nsaid that according to DHS, Pretti had a gun. At 11:31 a.m. Central time, DHS posted a statement on X.\n“At 9:05 AM CT, as DHS law enforcement officers were conducting a targeted operation in Minneapolis\nagainst an illegal alien wanted for violent assault, an individual approached US Border Patrol officers\nwith a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun, seen here,” DHS said, providing a picture of the handgun on\nwhat appears to be the seat of a car. “The officers attempted to disarm the suspect but the armed\nsuspect violently resisted. More details on the armed struggle are forthcoming. Fearing for his life and\nthe lives and safety of fellow officers, an agent fired defensive shots. … The suspect also had 2\nmagazines and no ID—this looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage\nand massacre law enforcement.”\nIn separate press conferences the same day, Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol commander in charge\nof the immigration operation in Minneapolis, and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem made similar statements,\nusing much of the DHS language, including the speculation that Pretti wanted to “kill” (Noem’s wording)\nor “massacre” (Bovino’s) law enforcement officers.\n“This looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law\nenforcement,” Bovino said.\nNoem said that Pretti had “attacked those officers, had a weapon on him, and multiple, dozens of\nrounds of ammunition, wishing to inflict harm on these officers coming, brandishing like that, and\nimpeding their work that they were doing.”\nBovino didn’t answer questions from reporters about when agents knew about Pretti’s firearm and\nwhether he ever brandished it at agents. “This is under investigation. Those facts will come to light,” he\nsaid.\nOn Truth Social, President Donald Trump posted the DHS picture of the firearm and raised questions\nabout intent, calling Pretti a “gunman.” Trump said: “This is the gunman’s gun, loaded (with two\nadditional full magazines!), and ready to go – What is that all about?”\nOn X, Stephen Miller, the White House’s homeland security adviser and a deputy chief of staff, went\nfurther than the DHS or Trump statements, writing that an “assassin tried to murder federal agents.”\nMultiple analyses of the videos of the incident available so far do not show Pretti holding the gun or\nthreatening law enforcement officials with it. Again, more information, particularly about Pretti’s earlier\ninteractions with law enforcement, may later be revealed.\nO’Hara told CBS News on Jan. 25, “I cannot speculate, but I do not have any – any evidence that I\nhave seen that suggests that the weapon was brandished.”\nJohn Cohen, a former acting DHS undersecretary for intelligence, a police trainer and an ABC News\ncontributor, told the network, “What the videos depict is that this guy did not walk up to anybody from\nCBP in a threatening manner.” Cohen said that “there’s nothing in the video evidence that we’ve seen\nthus far” to support DHS’ statement that he intended to shoot law enforcement officers.\nIn the videos, Pretti is seen holding his phone, appearing to record video of the federal officers in the\nstreet, moments before an altercation where agents push another apparent demonstrator to the ground\nand then use pepper spray on Pretti. Several agents then force Pretti to the ground as he appears to\nresist. An agent removes a gun from Pretti’s waistband, and Pretti is shot multiple times.\nThe Minnesota Star Tribune reviewed more than six videos as well as accounts from eyewitnesses.\n“The footage does not show him [Pretti] pointing a firearm, attempting to fire a weapon, or advancing\ntoward agents with a gun raised. He is instead captured holding a cellphone, appearing to record,” the\nnewspaper wrote.\n“Federal officials have released no evidence supporting claims about Pretti’s intent,” the Star Tribune\nalso said. “Under Minnesota law, carrying a handgun in public is legal with a permit, and law\nenforcement sources said Pretti was a lawful gun owner.”\nThe New York Times wrote in its analysis of videos, “About eight seconds after he is pinned, agents yell\nthat he has a gun, indicating that they may not have known he was armed until he was on the ground.”\nOne agent “pulls a gun from among the group that appears to match the profile of a firearm DHS said\nbelonged to Mr. Pretti. The agents appear to have him under their control, with his arms pinned near his\nhead. As the gun emerges from the melee, another agent aims his own firearm at Mr. Pretti’s back and\nappears to fire one shot at close range.” Update, Jan. 27: A second video analysis by the Times shows\nthat “Pretti does not appear to pose a threat to agents,” the newspaper said.\nIn its breakdown of available videos, the Washington Post wrote that “[l]ess than a second” after an\nagent “emerged from the scrum” with Pretti’s firearm, “the first of what appear to be 10 shots was fired.\nIt is not clear from the video whether the other agents realized Pretti — who local authorities believe\nhad a permit to carry the weapon — had been disarmed.”\nHearst Television’s National Investigative Unit also reviewed multiple video angles of the shooting. One\nangle shows an officer crouching at Pretti’s side, Hearst said, and “searching Pretti’s clothing and is\nheard saying, ‘Where’s the gun?’ Another officer, a distance away, responds, ‘I’ve got the gun.'”\n“At no time in any of the three videos reviewed is Pretti seen brandishing a gun,” Hearst said.\nCNN said that “taken together,” cell phone footage from multiple angles, appears “at odds with the\nDepartment of Homeland Security’s initial claims about the lead up to officers firing on Alex Pretti.”\nOne of the videos it analyzed “seems to show officers approaching Pretti instead of the other way\naround. We’ll see later that Pretti does appear to have had a gun in his waistband, but this video shows\nhe didn’t have a gun in his hand, only a phone,” CNN said.\nOn Jan. 25, a day after the shooting, CNN’s Dana Bash repeatedly pressed Bovino about the evidence\nbehind DHS’ statements. She asked whether Pretti was “brandishing” the gun, as Noem had said. “Was\nhe brandishing it? Was he a threat because he had a gun in his hand that put law enforcement in\ndanger?” Bash asked.\nBovino responded: “Dana, we heard the law enforcement officer say, ‘Gun, gun, gun.’ So, at some\npoint, they knew there was a gun. So, again, that is going to be part of that investigation as to what was\nhappening on the ground there between those victims, the Border Patrol agent victims, and the\nsuspect.” He later said that Pretti “brought a semiautomatic weapon to a riot, assaulted federal officers,\nand at some point they saw that weapon. So I do believe the secretary is 100% spot on in what she\nsaid.”\nWe asked DHS about the agency’s early statements on the shooting, including what Noem meant when\nshe said Pretti was “brandishing” a weapon. We haven’t received a response.\nCNN said when it asked DHS about an agent removing Pretti’s gun before the shooting, it repeated the\nstatement that “officers attempted to disarm the suspect but the armed suspect violently resisted.”\nWhen asked on Jan. 25 by a Wall Street Journal reporter whether the shooting by federal agents was\njustified, Trump didn’t defend the shooting as DHS had. “We’re looking, we’re reviewing everything and\nwill come out with a determination,” he said.\n“I don’t like any shooting. I don’t like it,” Trump said, according to the Journal. “But I don’t like it when\nsomebody goes into a protest and he’s got a very powerful, fully loaded gun with two magazines loaded\nup with bullets also. That doesn’t play good either.”\nD’Angelo Gore contributed to this story.\nEditor’s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising. We rely on grants and individual donations\nfrom people like you.

[ more › ]\n\nNew York City officials now say eight people were found dead outside in freezing conditions since\nSaturday, as the city continues to recover from its heaviest snowstorm in years.\nTwo of those people were found dead outside on Monday morning, in Brooklyn and the Bronx.\nTemperatures were in the low-20s Monday morning, and had reached down into the teens the day\nbefore. Temperatures in New York City are expected to remain below freezing through the end of the\nweek.\nPolice said that at around 8:15 a.m., officers found a man unresponsive outside of 3651 Jerome Ave. in\nthe Norwood section of the Bronx. EMS workers later pronounced him dead on the scene. Police said\nthe man has not yet been identified.\nAbout 45 minutes later, a 90-year-old woman was found unresponsive in front of an apartment building\nin Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and was pronounced dead on the scene, police said. Police said the\nwoman’s identification was being withheld pending family notification.\nThe medical examiner’s office is investigating the cause of death in all eight cases.\nAndrew Chappotin has been homeless for three years. He said he spent much of Friday night walking\naround, before deciding to make his way to his sister's house, something he said he only does in\nemergencies to avoid imposing on what he described as an already crowded apartment.\n“It’s bone-chilling cold — it burns. It burns, and it makes the body stop, and it's sneaky… one minute,\nI'm able to stand up and be okay, and then the next minute, my feet and fingertips would get so cold, it\nfelt like they got chopped off and I was unable to move,” he said. “The pain from defrosting from that is\nvery hurtful, but the pain from just being in that constant cold, and it didn't matter how many layers I had\non, it got through.”\nChappotin said when he heard of the people found dead, he knew he had made the right decision to\nget inside.\n“I could have easily been one of those victims,” he said. “There have been times that I was in distress\noutside, publicly in distress, I needed help, and I’ve had dozens upon dozens of people just walk past\nme in those moments… Those 8 people that passed away — I'm pretty sure that somebody ignored\nthem as well. Somebody had to have saw them and just did not care.”\nDuring a press conference on Monday, Mayor Zohran Mamdani said a number of the New Yorkers who\ndied had previously had contact with the city’s shelter system, though it was still too early to “share a\nbroader diagnosis or a cause of death.”\nHe also urged New Yorkers to call 311 if they believe someone outside in the cold needs help. All such\ncalls will be rerouted to 911 as the city remains in Code Blue — the emergency protocol when\ntemperatures drop below freezing through the night.\nHe added that shelters have an open-door policy during Code Blue declarations, meaning no one is\nturned away during the cold.\n“I send my deepest condolences to the families and the loved ones of those New Yorkers that lost their\nlives,” he said. “Any loss of life is truly a tragedy, and that's why we're continuing to urge New Yorkers\nto get to a safe and warm location, and also if they see anyone who is in need of assistance to call\n311.”\nAccording to the mayor, more than 170 homeless New Yorkers have been placed in shelters or other\nindoor locations since the Code Blue started. Department of Social Services Commissioner Molly\nWasow Park said at least three people were forcibly taken to hospitals due to medical necessity.\n“An individual who is not appropriately dressed, who is wet, who is unable to acknowledge that there\nare real dangers, that is the kind of instance, particularly in this weather, where we will take somebody\nto the hospital,” she said.\nThis story has been updated with comment from Andrew Chappotin."}

Tom\nSuozzi.\n“I failed to view the DHS funding vote as a referendum on the illegal and immoral conduct of ICE\n[Immigration and Customs Enforcement] in Minneapolis,” Suozzi said in a statement just days after\njoining with six other Democrats and House Republicans to pass the measure.\nBut the tragedy has also diminished some GOP support for President Trump’s illegal immigration\ncrackdown in the Land of 10,000 Lakes — and led to calls for greater congressional oversight of the\nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n8 Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has already come out as a firm “no” vote. Getty\nImages\nBoth chairmen tasked with that oversight — Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Rep. Andrew Garbarino\n(R-NY) — have called for public testimony from DHS officials.\nOther Republicans have suggested ICE should withdraw from Minneapolis and rebuked a “rush to\njudgment” on the incident from Trump administration officials.\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Saturday that Pretti “came with weapons and\nammunition to stop a law enforcement operation” and “committed an act of domestic terrorism.”\n8 Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Saturday that Pretti “came with weapons and\nammunition to stop a law enforcement operation” and “committed an act of domestic terrorism.”\nDouliery Olivier/ABACA/Shutterstock\nWhite House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller called the 37-year-old, who worked as an ICU nurse\nfor the Department of Veterans Affairs, a “would-be assassin” who “tried to murder federal law\nenforcement.”\nCongressional Republicans have urged caution about such statements before an internal investigation\ninto the shooting concludes, with Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah) calling Noem’s response “premature” and\nblaming the DHS boss for having “weakened” Americans’ confidence in federal law enforcement.\nBut Democrats have cited Pretti’s death as proof of the need for a partial government shutdown,\ndemanding that DHS funding be stripped from the broader House-passed appropriations package —\nincluding two senators who helped end an unprecedented, 43-day halt to federal functions last year.\n8 Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah) called Noem’s response “premature.” Getty Images\nOne of those senators, John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, said Monday that he “reject[s] calls to defund\nor abolish ICE” but backs pulling DHS spending for the “ungovernable and dangerous” actions of\nofficers, urging his colleagues to instead vote on five other bills to keep the government mostly open.\n“It is unlikely that will happen and our country will suffer another shutdown,” Fetterman warned. Senate\nMinority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has already come out as a firm “no” vote.\nNevada Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, another Democrat who voted to reopen the government last\nNovember, agreed and said 96% of the budget had already been agreed to on a bipartisan basis.\n8 The killing of Alex Pretti during a confrontation over immigration enforcement on the streets of\nMinneapolis Saturday has emboldened Democrats’ opposition to a funding package slated for a Senate\nvote. AP\nBut the whole package was also worked through by House and Senate appropriations leaders from\nboth parties, one senior GOP aide stressed to The Post.\n“If Democrats back out of the current bipartisan funding deal, why would they expect Republicans to\nrenegotiate?” the aide said.\nUS Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino and some agents were also ordered out of Minneapolis later\nMonday in a concession that may give Democrats such as Fetterman enough breathing room to back\nDHS funding.\n8 Video footage shows one officer shouting “gun” and grabbing what authorities later said was a loaded\nSig Sauer pistol from Pretti.\n“Hopefully Senate Democrats, who are actively engaged in conversations, can find a path forward to\njoin us before this week’s funding deadline hits,” said a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader John\nThune (R-SD).\nSenate Republicans, who have a 53-vote majority, also expressed zero interest in breaking up the\nsix-bill package, which will need Democratic support to break the 60-vote filibuster.\nTrump also dispatched border czar Tom Homan to work through disagreements with Minneapolis\nMayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz after having what he described as a “good” calls with\nboth.\n8 One officer then walked away with the Sig P320 in hand while another swiftly got up and fired multiple\nrounds into the nurse. DHS\nDHS officials have previously blamed Frey — who presides over a so-called “sanctuary” city — and\nWalz for failing to cooperate with federal immigration authorities and putting “nearly 470 criminal illegal\naliens” back on the streets, where some have gone on to commit more crimes.\n“I encourage local officials in Minnesota to work with the administration to keep communities safe and\ncontinue the important work of enforcing our laws and getting dangerous criminals off of America’s\nstreets,” Thune said Monday, without indicating support for splitting up spending bills.\nHomeland Security Investigations is still reviewing body camera video footage of the immigration\nofficers whom Pretti confronted amid mass deportations — and anti-ICE protests — in Minnesota’s\nlargest city.\n8 US Border Patrol chief Greg Bovino and some agents were also ordered out of Minneapolis later\nMonday. REUTERS\nVideo footage shows one officer shouting “gun” and grabbing what authorities later said was a loaded\nSig Sauer pistol from Pretti after he got in their faces and a scuffle ensued, with officers seeking to\narrest the nurse and bringing him to the ground.\nOne officer then walked away with the Sig P320 in hand while another swiftly got up and fired multiple\nrounds into the nurse. It’s unclear if the handgun misfired while in the officer’s custody. Pretti died at the\nscene.\nOn Jan. 7, an ICE officer shot and killed Renee Good, also 37, as she accelerated her vehicle in the\nofficer’s direction as part of the Trump administration’s “Operation Metro Surge” in Minneapolis.\n8 President Trump dispatched border czar Tom Homan to work through disagreements with\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. REUTERS\nThe FBI conducted an initial review of that incident, and agents from the bureau are also assisting in a\nprobe of the Pretti slaying. State authorities are looking into Good’s death. Democrats and Republicans\nhave also called for independent investigations of both shootings.\nSuozzi, one of seven House Democrats last week who approved DHS funding for fiscal year 2026,\ncalled the killings “watershed moments in our nation’s history.”\nThe spending bills narrowly passed the House in a 220-207 vote, with a total of $64.4 billion in funding\nfor DHS. Democrats on the Appropriations Committee previously boasted of having reduced ICE\nspending by $115 million and Border Patrol spending by $1.8 billion in the measure."}

Thanks to Greg’s Browser, a terrific indie app, I’d been using column view on classic Mac OS\nsince 1993, a few years before Apple even bought NeXT, let alone finally shipped Mac OS X (which\nwas when column view first appeared in the Finder). One frustration inherent to column view is that it\ndoesn’t work well with long filenames. It’s a waste of space to resize all columns to a width long enough\nto accommodate long filenames, but it’s frustrating when a long filename doesn’t fit in a regular-width\ncolumn.\nI do not want to know how much time I have spent over the years adjusting the widths of columns. This\nis one of those “saved a dozen lives” kind of features. It’s great that Finder just does the right thing with\nthis setting turned on:"}

The reasons are varied, but often boil down to a combination\nof temperament, past experiences, and the manner in which the ferret is handled; understanding these\nfactors is crucial for building a stronger, more positive relationship.\nIntroduction: More Than Just a Fuzzy Tube\nFerrets are captivating creatures, renowned for their playful antics and boundless energy. Many\nfirst-time owners are eager to shower them with affection, but quickly discover that their ferret doesn’t\nseem to appreciate cuddles or petting. This can be frustrating, but understanding the underlying\nreasons why your ferret doesn’t like to be touched is the first step in building a more harmonious\nrelationship. Ferrets, unlike dogs, weren’t bred for unwavering human companionship. Their ancestors\nwere solitary hunters, and this lineage influences their interaction preferences. They express affection\nin different ways, often through playful nipping, excited dooking, or simply following you around.\nExpecting them to immediately enjoy being held and petted is unrealistic.\nTemperament and Personality: No Two Ferrets Are Alike\nJust like people, ferrets have individual personalities. Some are naturally more outgoing and tolerant of\nhandling than others. A ferret’s temperament can be influenced by genetics, early socialization, and\npast experiences.\nGenetics: Some ferrets are simply predisposed to being more independent or wary.\nSome ferrets are simply predisposed to being more independent or wary. Socialization: Ferrets that\nwere handled frequently and positively from a young age are generally more comfortable with human\ninteraction.\nFerrets that were handled frequently and positively from a young age are generally more comfortable\nwith human interaction. Past Experiences: Negative experiences, such as rough handling or being\nstartled, can create a lasting aversion to being touched.\nIt’s crucial to respect your ferret’s individual personality. Attempting to force affection can worsen the\nproblem and damage your bond. Observe your ferret’s body language and learn to recognize signs of\nstress or discomfort.\nHandling Techniques: Approach Matters\nThe way you approach and handle your ferret can significantly impact its willingness to be touched.\nAvoid sudden movements or grabbing, which can be perceived as threatening.\nSlow and Steady: Approach your ferret slowly and calmly, speaking in a soothing voice.\nApproach your ferret slowly and calmly, speaking in a soothing voice.

Offer treats instead. Grabbing or startling Approach slowly and calmly.\nSpeak softly. Ignoring signs of stress Stop the interaction immediately. Punishing biting Redirect biting\nbehavior with a toy.\nFrequently Asked Questions About Ferret Handling\nWhy does my ferret bite when I try to pick it up?\nBiting can stem from several reasons. Your ferret might be scared, insecure, or have a medical issue\ncausing pain when touched. Sometimes, it is playful biting. The context is key: a fearful bite is usually\naccompanied by hissing or puffing of the tail, while a playful bite is often followed by dooking. Reduce\nthe fear by slowing your movements and offering a treat.\nHow can I tell if my ferret is comfortable being petted?\nA relaxed ferret will typically have a loose body posture, slightly drooping eyes, and may even grind its\nteeth softly (ferret purring). Avoid petting them if they are tense, squirming, or trying to escape.\nIs it possible to train a ferret to enjoy being touched?\nYes, with patience and consistent positive reinforcement, you can train your ferret to tolerate and even\nenjoy being touched. Focus on associating your touch with positive experiences, such as treats and\ngentle praise. It’s not always guaranteed, but consistent, positive reinforcement can build trust over\ntime.\nWhat areas of the ferret’s body are most likely to be sensitive?\nGenerally, ferrets tend to be less sensitive on their head, neck, and back. Avoid touching their paws or\ntail without introducing your touch slowly, as these are often sensitive areas. It varies based on the\nindividual animal.\nHow often should I handle my ferret?\nAim for daily interactions, even if they are brief. Consistent, positive interaction helps to build trust and\nstrengthen your bond. But, if your ferret consistently dislikes handling, consider handling only a couple\nof times a week, until some trust has been built, at which point you can increase the frequency.\nWhat type of treats are most effective for positive reinforcement?\nFerrets have individual preferences, but common favorites include meat-based treats, such as meat\nbaby food, small pieces of cooked chicken, or ferret-specific treats. Experiment to see what motivates\nyour ferret the most.\nMy ferret used to enjoy being touched, but now it doesn’t. Why?\nThis change in behavior could indicate a medical issue causing pain or discomfort, a negative\nexperience that made your ferret wary, or even just a change in personality. If you suspect a medical\nissue, consult your veterinarian.\nHow important is early socialization in a ferret’s comfort with handling?\nEarly socialization is crucial. Ferrets that are handled frequently and positively from a young age are\ngenerally more comfortable with human interaction. Breeders who handle kits from a young age greatly\ninfluence their temperament as adults.\nWhat if my ferret has a history of abuse or neglect?\nFerrets with a history of abuse or neglect may require more patience and understanding. Focus on\ncreating a safe and predictable environment and avoid any actions that could trigger fear or anxiety.\nBuilding trust may take significant time.\nCan I use toys to help my ferret become more comfortable with being touched?\nYes! Use toys to distract your ferret while gently petting them. The distraction can help them focus on\nsomething else other than your touch.\nMy ferret seems fine being touched when it’s sleepy, but not when it’s awake. Why?\nThis is common. When sleepy, ferrets are more relaxed and less likely to resist handling. Use this\nopportunity to build positive associations by gently petting your ferret while it’s drowsy. Avoid doing so if\nyou need to wake them. Let them wake up naturally.\nWhen should I consult a veterinarian about my ferret’s aversion to being touched?\nConsult a veterinarian if you notice sudden changes in behavior, signs of pain or discomfort, or if your\nferret’s aversion to being touched is severe and preventing you from providing basic care."}

They do not arrive as forgotten names or misplaced\nkeys, but as changes so subtle they are almost impossible to notice: a slightly narrower vocabulary,\nless variation in description, a gentle flattening of language.\nNew research my colleagues and I conducted suggests that these changes may be detectable years\nbefore a formal diagnosis – and one of the clearest examples may lie hidden in the novels of Sir Terry\nPratchett.\nPratchett is remembered as one of Britain's most imaginative writers, the creator of the Discworld\nseries and a master of satire whose work combined humor with sharp moral insight.\nRelated: A Hidden Brain Signal Can Predict Alzheimer's Years Before Diagnosis\nFollowing his diagnosis of posterior cortical atrophy, a rare form of Alzheimer's disease, he became a\npowerful advocate for dementia research and awareness. Less well known is that the early effects of\nthe disease may already have been present in his writing long before he knew he was ill.\nDementia is often described as a condition of memory loss, but this is only part of the story. In its\nearliest stages, dementia can affect attention, perception, and language before memory problems\nbecome obvious.\nThese early changes are difficult to detect because they are gradual and easily mistaken for stress,\naging, or normal variation in behavior.\nLanguage, however, offers a unique window into cognitive change. The words we choose, the variety of\nour vocabulary, and the way we structure descriptions are tightly linked to brain function. Even small\nshifts in language use may reflect underlying neurological change.\nIn our recent study, we analyzed the language used across Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels,\nexamining how his writing evolved over time.\nWe focused on \"lexical diversity\" – a measure of how varied an author's word choices are – and paid\nparticular attention to adjectives, the descriptive words that give prose its texture, colour and emotional\ndepth.\nAcross Pratchett's later novels, there was a clear and statistically significant decline in the diversity of\nadjectives he used. The richness of descriptive language gradually narrowed.\nThis was not something a reader would necessarily notice, nor did it reflect a sudden deterioration in\nquality. Instead, it was a subtle, progressive change detectable only through detailed linguistic analysis.\nCrucially, the first significant drop appeared in The Last Continent, published almost ten years before\nPratchett received his formal diagnosis.\nThis suggests that the \"preclinical phase\" of dementia – the period during which disease-related\nchanges are already occurring in the brain – may have begun many years earlier, without obvious\noutward symptoms.\nThis finding has implications that extend far beyond literary analysis. Dementia is known to have a long\npreclinical phase, during which opportunities for early intervention are greatest. Yet identifying people\nduring this window remains one of the biggest challenges in dementia care.\nLinguistic analysis is not a diagnostic tool in itself, and it would not work equally well for everyone.\nFactors such as education, profession, writing habits, and linguistic background all influence how\npeople use language.\nBut as part of a broader approach — alongside cognitive tests, brain imaging, and biological markers –\nlanguage analysis could help detect early risk in a noninvasive and cost-effective way.\nImportantly, language data already exists. People generate vast amounts of written material through\nemails, reports, messages, and online communication. With appropriate safeguards for privacy and\nconsent, subtle changes in writing style could one day help flag early cognitive decline long before daily\nfunctioning is affected.\nWhy early detection matters\nEarly detection matters more than ever. In recent years, new drugs for Alzheimer's disease have\nemerged that aim to slow disease progression rather than simply manage symptoms.\nDrugs such as lecanemab and donanemab target amyloid proteins that accumulate in the brain and are\nthought to play an important role in the disease. Clinical trials suggest these treatments would be most\neffective when given early, before significant neuronal damage has occurred.\nRelated: Scientists Discover Speech Trait That Foreshadows Cognitive Decline\nIdentifying people during the preclinical phase would allow people and their families more time to plan,\naccess support, and consider interventions that may help slow progression. These may include lifestyle\nchanges, cognitive stimulation and, increasingly, new drugs to slow the disease progression.\nMore than a decade after his death, Terry Pratchett continues to contribute to our understanding of\ndementia. His novels remain deeply loved, but hidden within them is another legacy: evidence that\ndementia may leave its mark long before it announces itself.\nPaying closer attention to language – even language we think we know well – could help transform how\nwe detect, understand, and ultimately treat this devastating condition.\nThom Wilcockson, Senior Lecturer in Psychology, Loughborough University; Ahmet Begde, Research\nAssociate, Dementia, University of Oxford, and Melody Pattison, Lecturer in Linguistics, Cardiff\nUniversity\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

In most situations, the best course of\naction is to leave the fawn undisturbed, allowing the mother to return. Only intervene if the fawn is\nclearly injured, orphaned due to the confirmed death of the mother, or in immediate danger.\nUnderstanding Fawn Behavior and Maternal Care\nMany well-intentioned individuals find fawns alone in the woods or fields and, assuming they are\norphaned or abandoned, attempt to “rescue” them. However, this is often a misguided act, doing more\nharm than good. Understanding normal fawn behavior and maternal care is crucial before considering\nany intervention.\nThe Deer’s Natural Strategies\nDeer, and especially their fawns, have evolved to thrive in environments with numerous predators. A\nkey element of their survival strategy is for the doe (mother) to leave the fawn hidden for extended\nperiods, often returning only a few times a day to nurse. This minimizes the risk of the doe attracting\npredators to the fawn’s location.\nCamouflage: Fawns are born with a dappled coat that provides excellent camouflage, allowing them to\nblend seamlessly into their surroundings.\nFawns are born with a dappled coat that provides excellent camouflage, allowing them to blend\nseamlessly into their surroundings.

Observe from a distance without approaching. Fawn is\nvisibly injured or entrapped Contact a licensed wildlife rehabilitator immediately. Follow their\ninstructions carefully. Fawn is unresponsive or appears ill Contact a licensed wildlife rehabilitator\nimmediately. Provide details about the fawn’s condition. Confirmed death of the mother Contact a\nlicensed wildlife rehabilitator immediately. Document the location where the fawn was found.\nUncertainty about the fawn’s situation Observe from a distance for at least 24 hours. If the fawn\nremains alone and appears distressed, contact a rehabilitator.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nIf I touch a fawn, will the mother reject it?\nWhile it’s best to minimize contact, the myth that a mother deer will automatically reject a fawn touched\nby humans is largely untrue. Deer rely more on scent for predator detection than for identifying their\nyoung. However, wearing gloves helps minimize the transfer of human scent.\nHow long can a fawn survive without its mother?\nA newborn fawn can only survive for a short period – perhaps 24-48 hours – without its mother’s milk.\nHowever, older fawns can survive longer, especially if they are able to forage on their own.\nWhat if I see a fawn in my yard?\nSeeing a fawn in your yard is not necessarily a cause for alarm. The mother may be nearby, foraging or\nresting. Keep pets indoors and avoid approaching the fawn. Give the doe space to come back and\nretrieve it.\nIs it legal to keep a fawn as a pet?\nNo, it is illegal to keep a fawn as a pet in most jurisdictions. Deer are wild animals and require\nspecialized care that most people cannot provide. Furthermore, keeping a wild animal without the\nproper permits can result in fines or other penalties.\nWhat should I do if a fawn is hit by a car?\nIf a fawn is hit by a car, your priority is safety. Pull over to a safe location and contact animal control or a\nwildlife rehabilitator. Do not attempt to move the fawn yourself unless it is in immediate danger.\nHow can I tell if a fawn is dehydrated?\nSigns of dehydration in a fawn include sunken eyes, dry mouth, and a loss of skin elasticity. Gently\npinch a small amount of skin on the fawn’s neck. If it doesn’t quickly return to its normal position, the\nfawn may be dehydrated. Contact a rehabilitator immediately.\nWhat does a healthy fawn look like?\nA healthy fawn will be alert, responsive, and have a shiny coat. It will be able to stand and move around\nrelatively easily.\nWhat time of year are fawns typically born?\nFawning season typically occurs in the late spring and early summer (May to July in many regions).\nWhat is the best way to observe a fawn without disturbing it?\nThe best way to observe a fawn is from a distance, using binoculars or a spotting scope. Avoid\napproaching the fawn directly and make sure your scent doesn’t drift toward it.\nIf I find a dead fawn, should I report it?\nReporting a dead fawn can be helpful for wildlife managers, especially if it appears to be the result of\ndisease or poaching. Contact your local wildlife agency.\nHow can I protect fawns from predators in my area?\nKeeping pets indoors, especially at night, and removing potential attractants (such as pet food left\noutdoors) can help protect fawns from predators. Avoid creating dense underbrush that can provide\ncover for predators.\nWhere can I find a licensed wildlife rehabilitator near me?\nYou can find a licensed wildlife rehabilitator by searching online for “[your location] wildlife rehabilitator”\nor by contacting your local animal control agency or humane society. It is vital to utilize the help of\nprofessionals when deciding when you should rescue a fawn."}

Debunking the Myth\nThe incidence of rabies in opossums is extremely low, making it very unlikely for a possum to carry the\ndisease. This misconception arises because opossums are frequently reported to animal control,\nleading to a false association with rabies risk.\nIntroduction: The Misunderstood Possum\nOpossums, often called possums (although technically, that term is more accurate for Australian\nmarsupials), are fascinating creatures that play a crucial role in our ecosystems. They are nature’s\nclean-up crew, devouring insects, rodents, and carrion. However, they are often misunderstood and\nfeared, primarily due to misinformation surrounding rabies. The question of How many possums carry\nrabies? is a persistent one, fueled by fear and a lack of accurate knowledge. This article aims to dispel\nthe myths surrounding possums and rabies and provide a clear understanding of the actual risks.\nWhy the Rabies Myth Persists\nThe misconception that possums are rabies carriers stems from several factors:\nAppearance: Their nocturnal habits and sometimes ragged appearance can contribute to a perception\nof disease.\nTheir nocturnal habits and sometimes ragged appearance can contribute to a perception of disease.\nReporting Frequency: Possums are often reported to animal control due to their scavenging behavior or\nperceived nuisance, leading to increased testing for rabies – even if they are unlikely to be infected.\nPossums are often reported to animal control due to their scavenging behavior or perceived nuisance,\nleading to increased testing for rabies – even if they are unlikely to be infected. Misinformation: Old\nwives’ tales and inaccurate information perpetuate the belief that possums are a significant rabies\nthreat.\nPossum Biology and Resistance\nThe biology of the opossum actually makes it less susceptible to rabies compared to other mammals,\nsuch as raccoons, skunks, and bats, which are primary rabies reservoirs. Their low body temperature\n(94-97°F) makes it more difficult for the rabies virus to thrive.\nFactor Explanation —————— ——————————————————————————————\n———————————————————————————– Body Temperature Their lower body\ntemperature makes it harder for the rabies virus to replicate. Immune System While not definitively\nproven, some research suggests possums may have a more robust innate immune response to certain\nviruses, although this is still an area of active study. Solitary Nature Possums are largely solitary\nanimals, reducing their contact with other animals and, therefore, the opportunities for viral\ntransmission.\nOfficial Rabies Surveillance Data\nData from public health organizations consistently shows that rabies in opossums is remarkably rare.\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States, possums\naccount for a very small percentage of reported rabies cases each year. The vast majority of rabies\ncases are found in other wildlife species. Reviewing the data, the answer to “How many possums carry\nrabies?” remains: Very few.\nSafe Interactions with Possums\nWhile the risk of contracting rabies from a possum is minimal, it’s essential to practice caution and\nrespect wildlife.\nAvoid direct contact: Never attempt to handle or feed wild animals, including possums.\nNever attempt to handle or feed wild animals, including possums. Secure your property: Eliminate food\nsources (pet food, unsecured garbage) that might attract possums.\nEliminate food sources (pet food, unsecured garbage) that might attract possums. Keep pets\nvaccinated: Ensure your pets are up-to-date on their rabies vaccinations.\nEnsure your pets are up-to-date on their rabies vaccinations. Seek professional help: If you find a sick\nor injured possum, contact your local animal control or wildlife rehabilitation center.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWhy are possums mistakenly associated with rabies?\nThe misconception arises from a combination of factors. Possums are frequently reported to animal\ncontrol due to their scavenging behavior around homes. These reports then lead to testing for rabies,\neven if it’s highly unlikely. Their appearance also leads to fears of disease. Therefore, it’s not unusual to\nhear the question: “How many possums carry rabies?“.\nIs it safe to have possums in my yard?\nGenerally, yes. Possums play a helpful role by eating insects, rodents, and carrion. However, it’s\nimportant to secure garbage cans and pet food to prevent them from becoming a nuisance. Keep a\nsafe distance and don’t attempt to interact with them directly.\nWhat should I do if a possum approaches me?\nThe best approach is to remain calm and give the possum space. They are generally not aggressive\nand will usually move away if they feel threatened. Do not attempt to touch or corner the animal.\nCan my pet get rabies from a possum?\nWhile the risk is low, it’s not impossible. The biggest danger is not rabies, but rather the potential for\nfights or injuries from possums defending themselves. Ensure your pets are vaccinated against rabies\nand avoid letting them interact with wild animals.\nHow can I tell if a possum is sick?\nSigns of illness in a possum include unusual behavior, such as daytime activity, lethargy, difficulty\nwalking, or excessive drooling. These signs could indicate a variety of ailments, including rabies, but\nare more likely to indicate other illnesses or injuries. Contact animal control or a wildlife rehabilitator if\nyou see an animal exhibiting these symptoms.\nDo possums carry other diseases?\nYes. Possums can carry fleas, ticks, mites, and potentially other parasites and diseases. However,\nthese are usually not easily transmitted to humans or pets. The same basic precautions for handling\nany wild animal should be followed.\nWhat is the best way to keep possums away from my house?\nThe key is to remove attractants. Secure garbage cans with tight-fitting lids, bring pet food indoors at\nnight, and eliminate potential nesting sites, such as woodpiles or overgrown vegetation.\nAre baby possums dangerous?\nBaby possums, like all baby animals, are vulnerable and should not be approached or handled. Their\nmothers are fiercely protective. While the babies themselves are not inherently dangerous, approaching\nthem can trigger a defensive response from the mother.\nIf I am bitten or scratched by a possum, what should I do?\nWash the wound thoroughly with soap and water immediately. Seek medical attention as soon as\npossible. Your doctor can assess the risk of infection and determine whether further treatment, such as\na tetanus shot, is necessary. Although the rabies risk is minimal, it is crucial to consult with a medical\nprofessional after any animal bite.\nAre possums protected animals?\nIn many areas, possums are not protected and can be legally trapped or killed. However, inhumane\ntreatment is generally illegal and unethical. Check your local regulations for specific information.\nTrapping and relocating possums is often ineffective, as new ones will simply move into the vacated\nterritory. Focusing on prevention is more effective.\nWhat is the role of possums in the ecosystem?\nPossums are beneficial scavengers, controlling insect and rodent populations. They also help clean up\ncarrion, reducing the spread of disease. They are a valuable part of the natural environment.\nIs it true that possums play dead?\nYes, this is a well-known defense mechanism known as “playing possum.” When threatened, they feign\ndeath, often emitting a foul odor to deter predators. This involuntary response can last for several\nminutes or even hours. It is a fascinating and effective survival strategy.\nConclusion: Living Harmoniously with Possums\nWhile the image of a rabid possum might be scary, the reality is that these animals are incredibly\nunlikely to carry the disease. Understanding their biology and behavior allows us to appreciate their role\nin the ecosystem and to take simple steps to coexist peacefully. Addressing the question “How many\npossums carry rabies?” accurately is crucial for public health and for the well-being of these\noften-misunderstood creatures. By educating ourselves and others, we can dispel the myths and\npromote a more informed and respectful relationship with the wildlife around us."}

While individual eagles can be trained for specific\ntasks by licensed professionals, fully taming one for personal ownership is illegal and ethically\nproblematic due to their wild nature and protected status.\nThe Majesty of the Bald Eagle: A Background\nThe bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is a magnificent apex predator, a symbol of freedom and\nstrength, and a national emblem of the United States. These powerful birds are renowned for their\nimpressive wingspan (up to 8 feet), keen eyesight, and formidable talons. They primarily feed on fish,\nbut their diet can also include birds, reptiles, and small mammals. Bald eagles are fiercely territorial and\ntypically mate for life, building massive nests that they reuse for years. Understanding their natural\nbehaviors and inherent wildness is crucial to address the question of whether or not they can be tamed.\nLegal Protections: The Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act\nIt’s paramount to understand the legal framework surrounding bald eagles. Two major pieces of\nlegislation protect these birds in the United States:\nThe Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA): This act protects nearly all native bird species, including bald\neagles, from being hunted, captured, killed, or sold without authorization.\nThe Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act: Specifically designed for eagles, this law prohibits anyone\nfrom taking, possessing, selling, purchasing, bartering, offering to sell, purchase or barter, transporting,\nexporting or importing, at any time or in any manner, any bald eagle or golden eagle, alive or dead, or\nany part, nest, or egg thereof belonging to such eagles.\nThese laws make it illegal for private citizens to possess or attempt to “tame” a bald eagle. Exceptions\nare very limited and primarily granted to licensed falconers, rehabilitators, and researchers who meet\nstringent requirements.\nFalconry and Bald Eagles: A Limited Intersection\nFalconry is an ancient art of hunting with trained raptors. While traditionally associated with hawks and\nfalcons, some falconers are permitted to work with bald eagles under very specific circumstances.\nThese permits are extremely rare and require extensive experience and expertise.\nHere’s a breakdown of the key aspects:\nPermitting Process: The application process for a permit to possess and train a bald eagle is rigorous,\nrequiring years of experience handling other raptors and demonstrating a thorough understanding of\neagle behavior, husbandry, and conservation.\nThe application process for a permit to possess and train a bald eagle is rigorous, requiring years of\nexperience handling other raptors and demonstrating a thorough understanding of eagle behavior,\nhusbandry, and conservation. Purpose: Even with a permit, the purpose of working with a bald eagle is\ngenerally limited to educational demonstrations, conservation efforts, or research projects, not personal\nownership or entertainment.\nEven with a permit, the purpose of working with a bald eagle is generally limited to educational\ndemonstrations, conservation efforts, or research projects, not personal ownership or entertainment.\nTraining Methods: Training methods focus on positive reinforcement and building a relationship of trust\nwith the eagle. Harsh methods are both ineffective and illegal.\nWelfare and Ethical Considerations: The Eagle’s Perspective\nBeyond the legal ramifications, the ethical considerations of attempting to “tame” a bald eagle are\nsignificant. These birds are inherently wild and adapted to a life of freedom. Confinement and forced\ninteraction can cause:\nStress and Anxiety: Eagles are highly sensitive and can experience significant stress from being kept in\ncaptivity, especially if they are not provided with adequate space, enrichment, and opportunities for\nnatural behaviors.\nEagles are highly sensitive and can experience significant stress from being kept in captivity, especially\nif they are not provided with adequate space, enrichment, and opportunities for natural behaviors.\nPhysical Harm: Improper handling can lead to injuries, both to the eagle and to the handler. Their\npowerful talons and beaks are capable of inflicting serious damage.\nImproper handling can lead to injuries, both to the eagle and to the handler. Their powerful talons and\nbeaks are capable of inflicting serious damage. Behavioral Problems: Eagles deprived of their natural\nenvironment and social interactions may develop abnormal behaviors, such as feather plucking,\npacing, or aggression.\nRehabilitation: A Different Kind of Human-Eagle Interaction\nWildlife rehabilitation centers play a vital role in rescuing and caring for injured or orphaned bald eagles.\nThe goal of rehabilitation is to restore the eagle to health and release it back into the wild. This process\ninvolves:\nMedical Treatment: Providing necessary veterinary care to address injuries or illnesses.\nProviding necessary veterinary care to address injuries or illnesses. Appropriate Diet: Ensuring the\neagle receives a nutritious diet that mimics its natural food sources.\nEnsuring the eagle receives a nutritious diet that mimics its natural food sources. Minimizing Human\nContact: Reducing human interaction as much as possible to prevent habituation and ensure the eagle\nretains its wild instincts.\nRehabilitators work hard to avoid taming the eagle, understanding that its best chance of survival\ndepends on remaining wild.\nThe Illusion of “Taming”: Why It’s Different from Domestication\nIt’s crucial to differentiate between “taming” and domestication. Domestication is a long-term\nevolutionary process that involves selectively breeding animals over generations to adapt them to living\nalongside humans. Bald eagles have not undergone this process. Any attempt to “tame” one is simply\nbreaking its spirit and suppressing its natural behaviors, not truly transforming it into a domestic animal.\nConclusion: Respecting the Wild Nature of the Bald Eagle\nCan you tame a bald eagle? The answer, definitively, is no. Legally, ethically, and practically, it is not\npossible to “tame” a bald eagle in the way one might tame a dog or cat. While trained eagles may exist\nfor specific purposes like conservation education, these birds remain wild at heart, and their well-being\nshould always be prioritized. Our responsibility is to protect and respect these magnificent creatures in\ntheir natural habitat, ensuring that future generations can witness their freedom and majesty.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWhat is the penalty for possessing a bald eagle without a permit?\nThe penalties for violating the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act are severe. They can include\nsubstantial fines (up to $100,000 for individuals and $200,000 for organizations), imprisonment (up to\none year), and forfeiture of any equipment used in the violation.\nAre there any circumstances where it’s legal to own a bald eagle?\nYes, but only under very limited circumstances and with the appropriate federal permits. These permits\nare typically issued to licensed falconers, Native American tribes for religious purposes, scientific\nresearchers, and educators who meet strict qualifications. Personal pet ownership is never permitted.\nHow long does a bald eagle typically live in the wild?\nBald eagles in the wild can live for 20-30 years on average. In captivity, with proper care, they can\nsometimes live even longer.\nWhat do bald eagles eat in the wild?\nBald eagles are primarily fish-eaters, but they are opportunistic feeders. Their diet can also include\nbirds, reptiles, amphibians, and small mammals. They are also known to scavenge carrion.\nHow can I tell the difference between a bald eagle and a golden eagle?\nAdult bald eagles have a distinctive white head and tail, while adult golden eagles are entirely brown.\nJuvenile bald eagles have mottled brown plumage and gradually develop their white head and tail as\nthey mature. Size can also be a factor, with golden eagles typically being slightly smaller.\nCan a bald eagle be trained like a parrot to perform tricks?\nWhile bald eagles can be trained using positive reinforcement techniques for specific purposes, such\nas flying demonstrations, training them to perform tricks like a parrot is not ethical or appropriate. Their\nnatural behaviors and well-being should always be prioritized.\nWhat should I do if I find an injured bald eagle?\nIf you find an injured bald eagle, do not approach it or attempt to handle it yourself. Contact your local\nwildlife rehabilitation center, animal control agency, or state wildlife agency immediately. They will have\nthe expertise and resources to safely rescue and care for the bird.\nWhat are the biggest threats to bald eagle populations?\nHistorically, the biggest threats to bald eagle populations were habitat loss, hunting, and pesticide\ncontamination (particularly DDT). Today, the main threats include habitat destruction, lead poisoning\n(from ingesting lead ammunition), and collisions with vehicles and power lines.\nHow did bald eagles recover from near extinction?\nThe recovery of the bald eagle is a conservation success story. It involved several key factors, including\nthe banning of DDT, the implementation of the Endangered Species Act, habitat protection efforts, and\nreintroduction programs. These efforts led to a significant increase in bald eagle populations across the\nUnited States.\nAre bald eagles dangerous to humans?\nWhile bald eagles are powerful birds with sharp talons and beaks, they are generally not considered\ndangerous to humans. Attacks are extremely rare and usually only occur if the eagle feels threatened\nor is defending its nest. It’s important to maintain a respectful distance and avoid approaching them.\nWhat role do bald eagles play in their ecosystem?\nBald eagles are apex predators, meaning they are at the top of the food chain. They play an important\nrole in regulating populations of their prey and maintaining the health and balance of their ecosystems.\nIf I can’t “tame” a bald eagle, how else can I help protect them?\nThere are many ways to help protect bald eagles, including supporting conservation organizations,\nadvocating for habitat protection, reducing your use of pesticides and lead ammunition, and reporting\nany suspected illegal activity involving eagles to the authorities. Even small actions can make a big\ndifference."}

By applying large language models (LLMs) to multiple review items that were previously\nhandled manually, the solution is expected to reduce digital advertiser review workloads by over 30%.\nDOOH advertiser reviews require checks against publicly available information on advertisers and\ncompliance with various guidelines. As the volume of DOOH ad placements has increased significantly\nin recent years, review time and operational costs have become major challenges. DOOH ad reviews\ngenerally consist of two components: advertiser review and creative review. This newly developed\nsolution focuses on streamlining advertiser reviews, which verify advertiser credibility as a prerequisite\nfor DOOH ad distribution.\nFigure 1. Solution Application Overview\nWhen using LLMs for advertiser reviews, two limitations arise: limited information freshness and limited\naccess to external resources. The former refers to the difficulty of keeping information up to date, while\nthe latter includes issues such as invalid URLs generated by LLMs. To address these challenges,\nDOCOMO developed this new solution by integrating five core technologies, enabling the AI to quickly\nobtain accurate and sufficient information for advertiser reviews.\nCore Technologies of the Solution\n1. Web search-based grounding technology 2. Automated generation of company profile research\nresults 3. Automated generation of legal compliance review results 4. Automated generation of risk\nassessment results 5. Automated generation of media-specific competitor analysis results\nGoing forward, DOCOMO aims to develop an AI-based technology to streamline creative reviews by\napplying AI to manual repetitive visual checks of video content for large public displays from the\nperspective of broadcast ethics and legal regulations. In addition, the company will continue to further\nenhance the efficiency of DOOH advertising review operations, aiming to refine advertising-related\ntechnologies and revitalize the advertising business. Through this, DOCOMO will pursue research and\ndevelopment to optimize the entirety of DOOH operations."}

Please proceed with caution.\nOn Jan. 24, 2026, at least one federal agent in Minneapolis fatally shot Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old nurse\nwho had been participating in protests against U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.\nVideos of the shooting quickly spread on social media, with many users questioning their authenticity.\nAn image claiming to show Pretti being shot and falling was among the content that spread online\nfollowing the shooting. The image appeared to capture Pretti wearing a brown jacket, on one knee and\nabout to fall onto his side. The right side of the image showed what appeared to be three federal\nagents: one kneeling on the ground, another with his gun pointed at Pretti's head and one holding a gun\nin the background.\nSnopes readers shared different versions of the image, which varied in quality. The one below shows\nmany details of the moment in question, including the shadows on people's clothes and Pretti's hair:\n(X user @fred_guttenberg)\nAnother version of the same image featured a blurry background:\n(Facebook user \"Tony Michaels\")\nNeither of the above images is an entirely authentic depiction of the moment in question. Rather, both\nappeared to be AI-enhanced and edited versions of a blurred screenshot taken from verified footage\nshowing Pretti being shot and falling to the ground. All footage of the incident that Snopes reviewed\nwas low-quality and blurry.\nA blurrier version of the above images spread online. Unlike the others, it was an authentic and\nunedited screengrab from a video showing the moment Pretti was shot.\n(X user @fred_guttenberg)\nDetermining the authenticity of the screengrab\nThe moment above appeared in authenticated footage of the shooting. The video below was taken by a\nwoman wearing pink and filming from the sidewalk, as confirmed by The New York Times and other\nmedia outlets. Pretti was shot and fell to his side around the 1:03 mark as seen in this video from Drop\nSite News.\nWe took a screengrab of that moment in the video:\n(Screengrab via Drop Site News)\nPretti falls to the side at the same angle seen in the claims above. The positioning of the federal agents\non the right side of the frame is also the same — one agent is kneeling with his right knee on the\nground and his left knee propped up, while another stands over Pretti.\nOn the left side of the AI-enhanced screengrab, only part of another agent's leg is visible, while in the\nauthentic video, he is in frame.\nMPR News, a Minnesota-focused news outlet, obtained a higher-quality version of the video. At 37\nseconds, Pretti can be seen falling sideways at the same angle shown in the above screenshot.\nA stabilized version of the video circulated online, showing clearly the moment Pretti falls. A screenshot\nof the moment is shown below:\n(X user @AFStreamWatch)\nA video taken from behind Pretti, in which the woman in pink can be seen filming, shows his body\nfalling to the left:\n(Screengrab via The New York Times)\nIdentifying editing, manipulation in enhanced videos\nThe images shared online contain a number of red flags. First, there is no available footage from that\nangle that shows the level of detail visible in the images.\nWe ran one of the enhanced images through AI-detection tools SightEngine and Hive Moderation.\nSightEngine determined it was uncertain whether the image had been manipulated using AI, while Hive\nModeration indicated a low likelihood that the image had AI-generated content. (Research shows\nAI-detection software is imperfect, and readers should consider the tools' results with skepticism.)\nThe second image in question contained several editing errors. First, the federal agent kneeling on the\nground is missing his left foot. Second, the dark-colored X logos on the pink door and window frames in\nthe background appear to be disrupted in multiple places. Original footage shows an uninterrupted\npattern of Xs in the background.\nPretti had been participating in protests after the killing of Renee Nicole Good by an Immigration and\nCustoms Enforcement agent in early January 2026. The Department of Homeland Security claimed he\napproached federal officers with a handgun. Bystander videos show he was holding only a phone, and\nnews analysis of the videos showed agents had already secured the handgun Pretti was carrying\nbefore shooting him. Pretti's family told The Associated Press that he had a permit to carry a concealed\nhandgun in Minnesota.\nSnopes has looked into rumors about photographs and footage surrounding shootings and arrests by\nfederal agents in Minneapolis, including miscaptioned photographs claiming to show Good before her\nkilling."}

Stephen Hawking Gives the\nDefinitive Answer to the Eternal Question\n\n\"The universe is the ultimate free lunch.\"\n\n“Every formula which expresses a law of nature is a hymn of praise to God,” the trailblazing astronomer\nand leading Figuring figure Maria Mitchell wrote in the second half of the nineteenth century as she\ncontemplated science, spirituality, and the human hunger for truth. Every great scientist in the century\nand a half since has been faced with this question, be it by personal restlessness or public demand.\nEinstein addressed it in answering a little girl’s question about whether scientists pray. Quantum theory\noriginator Max Planck believed that “science cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature [because] we\nourselves are part of nature and therefore part of the mystery that we are trying to solve.” His fellow\nNobel laureate and quantum theory founding father Niels Bohr defied the sentiment in his incisive\ndistinction between subjective and objective reality, noting that religions have always addressed the\nformer, while science addresses the latter, which is measurable and therefore knowable. Wolfgang\nPauli, whose groundbreaking scientific ideas were greatly influenced by Bohr’s, concluded that the\neffort to reconcile science and religion “will always be full of pitfalls and one can fall down on both\nsides.”\nIt takes a mind of rare courage and insight to address this abiding question without falling into the most\npernicious trap of all — that of artificial compatibilism; to take a lucid stance without fright of offense,\nthen to explain the basis of that stance thoughtfully and sensitively, systematically dismantling every\nreflexive argument against it.\nThat is what Stephen Hawking (January 8, 1942–March 14, 2018) does in his final book, Brief Answers\nto the Big Questions (public library) — a collection of ten enormous questions Hawking was asked\nregularly throughout his life, by children and elders, by entrepreneurs and political leaders, by men and\nwomen young and old attending his prolific lectures and public appearances, with answers drawn from\nhis extensive personal archive of correspondence, notes, drafts, interviews, and essays. The book —\nwhich was conceived during Hawking’s lifetime but finished only after his death with help from his family\nand academic colleagues, and proceeds from which benefit the Stephen Hawking Foundation and the\nMotor Neurone Disease Association — opens with the question that has bellowed in humanity’s chest\nsince science first confronted superstition: Is there a God?\nHawking — whom many consider the greatest scientist since Einstein and whose residual stardust was\ninterred between Darwin’s and Newton’s in Westminster Abbey — enlists his disarming deadpan humor\nin placing the query in a personal context, then uses the fulcrum of his magnificent mind to pivot into the\nserious answer to the universal question:\nFor centuries, it was believed that disabled people like me were living under a curse that was inflicted\nby God. Well, I suppose it’s possible that I’ve upset someone up there, but I prefer to think that\neverything can be explained another way, by the laws of nature. If you believe in science, like I do, you\nbelieve that there are certain laws that are always obeyed. If you like, you can say the laws are the\nwork of God, but that is more a definition of God than a proof of his existence.\nWith an eye to the discovery, which began in antiquity and culminated with Kepler and Galileo, that “the\nheavens” are in fact a complex universe governed by discoverable and discernible physical laws, he\nbuilds upon his earlier reflections on the meaning of the universe and adds:\nI believe that the discovery of these laws has been humankind’s greatest achievement, for it’s these\nlaws of nature — as we now call them — that will tell us whether we need a god to explain the universe\nat all. The laws of nature are a description of how things actually work in the past, present and future. In\ntennis, the ball always goes exactly where they say it will. And there are many other laws at work here\ntoo. They govern everything that is going on, from how the energy of the shot is produced in the\nplayers’ muscles to the speed at which the grass grows beneath their feet. But what’s really important is\nthat these physical laws, as well as being unchangeable, are universal. They apply not just to the flight\nof a ball, but to the motion of a planet, and everything else in the universe. Unlike laws made by\nhumans, the laws of nature cannot be broken — that’s why they are so powerful and, when seen from a\nreligious standpoint, controversial too. […] One could define God as the embodiment of the laws of\nnature. However, this is not what most people would think of as God. They mean a human-like being,\nwith whom one can have a personal relationship. When you look at the vast size of the universe, and\nhow insignificant and accidental human life is in it, that seems most implausible. I use the word “God” in\nan impersonal sense, like Einstein did, for the laws of nature, so knowing the mind of God is knowing\nthe laws of nature. My prediction is that we will know the mind of God by the end of this century.\nBut even with the laws of nature conceded, Hawking recognizes that their existence still leaves room\nfor religions to lay claim to the grandest question — how the universe and its laws began. He\naddresses the question both plainly and profoundly:\nI think the universe was spontaneously created out of nothing, according to the laws of science. […]\nDespite the complexity and variety of the universe, it turns out that to make one you need just three\ningredients. Let’s imagine that we could list them in some kind of cosmic cookbook. So what are the\nthree ingredients we need to cook up a universe? The first is matter — stuff that has mass. Matter is all\naround us, in the ground beneath our feet and out in space. Dust, rock, ice, liquids. Vast clouds of gas,\nmassive spirals of stars, each containing billions of suns, stretching away for incredible distances. The\nsecond thing you need is energy. Even if you’ve never thought about it, we all know what energy is.\nSomething we encounter every day. Look up at the Sun and you can feel it on your face: energy\nproduced by a star ninety-three million miles away. Energy permeates the universe, driving the\nprocesses that keep it a dynamic, endlessly changing place. So we have matter and we have energy.\nThe third thing we need to build a universe is space. Lots of space. You can call the universe many\nthings — awesome, beautiful, violent — but one thing you can’t call it is cramped. Wherever we look we\nsee space, more space and even more space. Stretching in all directions.\nThe instinctual question is where all the matter, energy, and space came from — a question we hadn’t\nbeen able to answer with more than mythological cosmogonies until the early twentieth century, when\nEinstein demonstrated that mass is a form of energy and energy a form of mass in what is now the best\nknown equation in the history of the world: E=mc2. This reduces the ingredients of the “cosmic\ncookbook” from three to two, distilling the question to where the space and energy originated.\nGenerations of scientists built upon each other’s work to deliver the answer in the Big Bang model,\nwhich holds that in a single moment around 13.8 billion years ago, the entire universe, with all its space\nand energy, ballooned into being out of the nothingness that preceded it.\nHalf a century after Nabokov’s poetic admonition against common sense, Hawking echoes Carl\nSagan’s observation that common sense can blind us to the realities of the universe and addresses this\ndeeply counterintuitive notion of generating something out of nothing:\nAs I was growing up in England after the Second World War, it was a time of austerity. We were told\nthat you never get something for nothing. But now, after a lifetime of work, I think that actually you can\nget a whole universe for free. The great mystery at the heart of the Big Bang is to explain how an entire,\nfantastically enormous universe of space and energy can materialise out of nothing. The secret lies in\none of the strangest facts about our cosmos. The laws of physics demand the existence of something\ncalled “negative energy.” To help you get your head around this weird but crucial concept, let me draw\non a simple analogy. Imagine a man wants to build a hill on a flat piece of land. The hill will represent\nthe universe. To make this hill he digs a hole in the ground and uses that soil to dig his hill. But of\ncourse he’s not just making a hill — he’s also making a hole, in effect a negative version of the hill. The\nstuff that was in the hole has now become the hill, so it all perfectly balances out. This is the principle\nbehind what happened at the beginning of the universe. When the Big Bang produced a massive\namount of positive energy, it simultaneously produced the same amount of negative energy. In this\nway, the positive and the negative add up to zero, always. It’s another law of nature. So where is all this\nnegative energy today? It’s in the third ingredient in our cosmic cookbook: it’s in space. This may sound\nodd, but according to the laws of nature concerning gravity and motion — laws that are among the\noldest in science — space itself is a vast store of negative energy. Enough to ensure that everything\nadds up to zero. I’ll admit that, unless mathematics is your thing, this is hard to grasp, but it’s true. The\nendless web of billions upon billions of galaxies, each pulling on each other by the force of gravity, acts\nlike a giant storage device. The universe is like an enormous battery storing negative energy. The\npositive side of things — the mass and energy we see today — is like the hill. The corresponding hole,\nor negative side of things, is spread throughout space. So what does this mean in our quest to find out\nif there is a God? It means that if the universe adds up to nothing, then you don’t need a God to create\nit. The universe is the ultimate free lunch.\nThis is where the wheels of our common-sense understanding screech to a frustrated halt — after all, in\nour daily lives, we can’t just manifest a cone of ice cream or a long-lost lover with the snap of our\nfingers. But on the subatomic stratum undergirding our physical reality, things work differently —\nparticles pop up at random times in random places only to disappear again, governed by the laws of\nquantum mechanics, which seem downright mystical in their manifestation but are in fact discovered\nand calculable laws of the universe. Hawking explains:\nSince we know the universe itself was once very small — perhaps smaller than a proton — this means\nsomething quite remarkable. It means the universe itself, in all its mind-boggling vastness and\ncomplexity, could simply have popped into existence without violating the known laws of nature. From\nthat moment on, vast amounts of energy were released as space itself expanded — a place to store all\nthe negative energy needed to balance the books. But of course the critical question is raised again: did\nGod create the quantum laws that allowed the Big Bang to occur? In a nutshell, do we need a God to\nset it up so that the Big Bang could bang? I have no desire to offend anyone of faith, but I think science\nhas a more compelling explanation than a divine creator.\nOnce again he illustrates this assault on our basic common-sense intuitions with that supreme lever of\nunderstanding, the analogy:\nImagine a river, flowing down a mountainside. What caused the river? Well, perhaps the rain that fell\nearlier in the mountains. But then, what caused the rain? A good answer would be the Sun, that shone\ndown on the ocean and lifted water vapour up into the sky and made clouds. Okay, so what caused the\nSun to shine? Well, if we look inside we see the process known as fusion, in which hydrogen atoms join\nto form helium, releasing vast quantities of energy in the process. So far so good. Where does the\nhydrogen come from? Answer: the Big Bang. But here’s the crucial bit. The laws of nature itself tell us\nthat not only could the universe have popped into existence without any assistance, like a proton, and\nhave required nothing in terms of energy, but also that it is possible that nothing caused the Big Bang.\nNothing.\nThis explanation, Hawking points out, rests on the shoulders of Einstein’s groundbreaking relativity\ntheory — that daring leap of the imaginative intellect, which furnished the staggering revelation that\nspace and time are a single entity comprising the basic fabric of the universe. Hawking writes:\nSomething very wonderful happened to time at the instant of the Big Bang. Time itself began. To\nunderstand this mind-boggling idea, consider a black hole floating in space. A typical black hole is a\nstar so massive that it has collapsed in on itself. It’s so massive that not even light can escape its\ngravity, which is why it’s almost perfectly black. It’s gravitational pull is so powerful, it warps and distorts\nnot only light but also time. To see how, imagine a clock is being sucked into it. As the clock gets closer\nand closer to the black hole, it begins to get slower and slower. Time itself begins to slow down. Now\nimagine the clock as it enters the black hole — well, assuming of course that it could withstand the\nextreme gravitational forces– it would actually stop. It stops not because it is broken, but because\ninside the black hole time itself doesn’t exist. And that’s exactly what happened at the start of the\nuniverse. […] As we travel back in time towards the moment of the Big Bang, the universe gets smaller\nand smaller and smaller, until it finally comes to a point where the whole universe is a space so small\nthat it is in effect a single infinitesimally small, infinitesimally dense black hole. And just as with\nmodern-day black holes, floating around in space, the laws of nature dictate something quite\nextraordinary. They tell us that here too time itself must come to a stop. You can’t get to a time before\nthe Big Bang because there was no time before the Big Bang. We have finally found something that\ndoesn’t have a cause, because there was no time for a cause to exist in. For me this means that there\nis no possibility of a creator, because there is no time for a creator to have existed in.\nHawking concludes with his most direct, personal answer to the universal question:\nIt’s my view that the simplest explanation is that there is no God. No one created the universe and no\none directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realisation: there is probably no heaven and afterlife\neither. I think belief in an afterlife is just wishful thinking. There is no reliable evidence for it, and it flies\nin the face of everything we know in science. I think that when we die we return to dust. But there’s a\nsense in which we live on, in our influence, and in our genes that we pass on to our children. We have\nthis one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe, and for that I am extremely grateful.\nRather than dispiriting, this lucid awareness of our ephemerality can be the wellspring of our noblest,\nmost deeply spiritual and spiritualizing impulses — a catalyst for finding holiness in the richness of life\nitself, in the splendor of this peculiar and irreplaceable planet, rooted in the awareness that, in the\npoetic words of naturalist Sy Montgomery, “our world, and the worlds around and within it, is aflame\nwith shades of brilliance we cannot fathom — and is far more vibrant, far more holy, than we could ever\nimagine.” Hawking channels this orientation of mind and spirit in a stirring passage from the book’s\nintroduction:\nOne day, I hope we will know the answers to all these questions. But there are other challenges, other\nbig questions on the planet which must be answered, and these will also need a new generation who\nare interested and engaged, and have an understanding of science. How will we feed an ever-growing\npopulation? Provide clean water, generate renewable energy, prevent and cure disease and slow down\nglobal climate change? I hope that science and technology will provide the answers to these questions,\nbut it will take people, human beings with knowledge and understanding, to implement these solutions.\nLet us fight for every woman and every man to have the opportunity to live healthy, secure lives, full of\nopportunity and love. We are all time travellers, journeying together into the future. But let us work\ntogether to make that future a place we want to visit. Be brave, be curious, be determined, overcome\nthe odds. It can be done.\nComplement this particular portion of Hawking’s altogether magnificent Brief Answers to the Big\nQuestions with Carl Sagan on science and mystery, Alan Lightman on nonreligious divinity in the\nknown and the unknowable, and Buckminster Fuller’s scientific revision of “The Lord’s Prayer,” then\nrevisit poet Marie Howe’s gorgeous tribute to Hawking."}

In early July, just five weeks after giving birth, she ran a\nfive-mile race, according to the lawsuit.\nHer sister said that Clancy was “unlike her usual sensible self” and became sucked into a “multi-level\nmarketing scheme” for exercise products, which she tried to pass off to her friends and family, the\nlawsuit said.\nBy the end of the summer, Clancy’s mood “suddenly switched to anxiety and depression,” and living\nher daily life became a “chore.”\nIt was then that she “took the initiative” and sought out medical and psychiatric assistance — the same\nparties her husband, Patrick, accused of “overmedicating” Clancy in his own lawsuit filed last week.\nThe cocktail of prescriptions Clancy was prescribed on and off between October and December 2022\nincluded Zoloft, trazodone, Prozac, Ambien, Remeron, Klonopin, Seroquel, Ativan, Valium, and\nLamictal, according to Patrick and Clancy’s respective lawsuits.\n4 Clancy is still on suicide watch. Greg Derr/The Patriot Ledger / USA TODAY NETWORK via Imagn\nImages\n4 Clancy was prescribed at least 10 different medications between October and December 2022.\nFacebook / Lindsay Marie Clancy\nAfter months of trying to receive help from the defendants named in the lawsuit — the South Shore\nHealth System, Aster Mental Health Inc., the Women and Infants Hospital of Rhode Island, Dr. Jennifer\nTufts and nurse Rebecca Jollotta — a defeated Clancy started to wonder if she was a “psychopath.”\nJust four days before she allegedly killed her children, Clancy tried to research possible cures for\npsychopaths, the lawsuit said.\nClancy was overwhelmed by a “force” the day she allegedly killed her kids — one that had the same\naggressive, antagonistic male voice she claimed to have hallucinated since she was prescribed\nSeroquel, according to the lawsuit.\nShe whispered “Go to God, baby” to her children while they died before throwing herself out their\nhome’s second-story window, according to the lawsuit.\n4 Clancy tried to commit suicide immediately after she killed her children, but survived. Facebook /\nLindsay Marie Clancy\nA doctor officially diagnosed Clancy with severe bipolar disorder in September 2024, the lawsuit said.\nAntidepressants typically increase hypomanic symptoms and mood instabilities for people with bipolar\ndisorder.\nClancy is seeking an unspecified amount of money in damages for her medical expenses, lost wages,\npain and suffering, emotional distress, permanent disability, the loss of her family’s companionship, and\nthe devastation of her marriage.\nClancy, who is still on suicide watch, is scheduled to go on trial in late July.\nShe has pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder, three counts of strangulation, and three counts of\nassault and battery with a dangerous weapon.\nHer lawyer warned there is a “real probability” Clancy will try to kill herself during the trial. She has\nundergone round-the-clock supervision at the Tewksbury State Hospital since May 2023."}

The Truth About Their Population\nNo, bobcats are not considered rare. While they may be elusive and infrequently observed in certain\nareas, bobcat populations are generally healthy and widespread across North America.\nIntroduction to the Elusive Bobcat\nThe bobcat ( Lynx rufus ) is a medium-sized wild cat native to North America. Its adaptability to a\nvariety of habitats, from forests to deserts and even suburban areas, has contributed to its continued\nsuccess. However, the question “Is A bobcat rare?” is one that frequently arises, fueled by their\nsecretive nature and the challenges of accurately assessing their populations. While individual\nsightings may be infrequent, this does not necessarily indicate rarity. This article will delve into the\nfactors influencing bobcat populations, their distribution, and the challenges of determining their true\nabundance.\nThe Widespread Distribution of Bobcats\nOne of the key reasons bobcats are not considered rare is their remarkably broad geographic range.\nThey are found throughout most of the continental United States, southern Canada, and northern\nMexico. This wide distribution suggests a resilience and adaptability that helps them thrive in diverse\nenvironments. Unlike some specialized predators, bobcats are opportunistic hunters, able to adapt their\ndiet based on available prey. This dietary flexibility allows them to persist in regions where other\ncarnivores might struggle.\nFactors Contributing to Bobcat Population Health\nSeveral factors contribute to the generally healthy status of bobcat populations.\nAdaptability: Bobcats thrive in a variety of habitats, making them less vulnerable to habitat loss than\nmore specialized species.\nBobcats thrive in a variety of habitats, making them less vulnerable to habitat loss than more\nspecialized species. Dietary Flexibility: Their opportunistic hunting style allows them to adapt their diet\nbased on the available prey, increasing their chances of survival.\nTheir opportunistic hunting style allows them to adapt their diet based on the available prey, increasing\ntheir chances of survival. Reproductive Rate: Bobcats have a relatively high reproductive rate\ncompared to other wild cats, helping to maintain population levels.\nBobcats have a relatively high reproductive rate compared to other wild cats, helping to maintain\npopulation levels. Limited Competition: While they compete with other predators, their adaptability\nallows them to coexist effectively.\nChallenges in Assessing Bobcat Populations\nDetermining the precise number of bobcats across their vast range is a significant challenge. Their\nelusive nature and preference for dense cover make direct observation difficult. Researchers rely on a\nvariety of methods to estimate population sizes, including:\nCamera Trapping: Setting up remote cameras to capture images of bobcats in specific areas.\nSetting up remote cameras to capture images of bobcats in specific areas. Track Surveys: Identifying\nand counting bobcat tracks in snow or soft soil.\nIdentifying and counting bobcat tracks in snow or soft soil. Radio Telemetry: Attaching radio collars to\nbobcats to track their movements and home ranges.\nAttaching radio collars to bobcats to track their movements and home ranges. Genetic Analysis:\nAnalyzing DNA samples from scat or hair to estimate population size and genetic diversity.\nEach of these methods has its limitations, and estimates are often based on statistical models rather\nthan direct counts. This inherent uncertainty makes it difficult to definitively answer the question, “Is A\nbobcat rare?“, but the available data suggests they are not.\nConservation Status and Threats\nWhile bobcats are not currently classified as endangered or threatened at the federal level in the United\nStates, they are subject to hunting and trapping regulations in many states. These regulations are\ndesigned to manage populations sustainably and prevent overharvesting.\nPotential threats to bobcat populations include:\nHabitat Loss: While adaptable, bobcats are still affected by habitat loss due to urbanization, agriculture,\nand deforestation.\nWhile adaptable, bobcats are still affected by habitat loss due to urbanization, agriculture, and\ndeforestation. Vehicle Collisions: Bobcats are sometimes killed by vehicles, particularly in areas with\nhigh traffic density.\nBobcats are sometimes killed by vehicles, particularly in areas with high traffic density. Disease: Like\nother wild animals, bobcats are susceptible to diseases such as rabies, feline distemper, and mange.\nLike other wild animals, bobcats are susceptible to diseases such as rabies, feline distemper, and\nmange. Hunting and Trapping: Overharvesting can negatively impact local populations, especially in\nareas with limited habitat.\nCoexistence with Humans\nBobcats are increasingly encountered in suburban and even urban areas, leading to both opportunities\nand challenges for coexistence. While they generally avoid humans, they may be attracted to areas\nwith abundant prey, such as rodents or domestic cats. Understanding bobcat behavior and taking\nprecautions to minimize conflicts is crucial for ensuring their continued survival in human-dominated\nlandscapes.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWhat is the average lifespan of a bobcat?\nThe average lifespan of a bobcat in the wild is typically 7 to 10 years, although some individuals may\nlive longer. In captivity, they can live up to 20 years.\nAre bobcats dangerous to humans?\nBobcats are generally shy and reclusive and pose little threat to humans. Attacks are extremely rare.\nThey typically avoid humans and will only attack if they feel threatened or are protecting their young.\nWhat is the diet of a bobcat?\nBobcats are opportunistic predators with a varied diet that includes rodents, rabbits, birds, squirrels,\nand even deer. They will also occasionally prey on domestic cats and small livestock.\nHow can I tell the difference between a bobcat and a house cat?\nBobcats are larger than domestic cats with longer legs, a bobbed tail (hence the name), and distinctive\ntufts of fur on their ears. They also have a spotted or streaked coat pattern.\nWhere do bobcats typically live?\nBobcats are adaptable and can live in a variety of habitats, including forests, swamps, deserts, and\neven suburban areas. They prefer areas with dense cover for hunting and denning.\nWhat should I do if I encounter a bobcat?\nIf you encounter a bobcat, do not approach it. Give it plenty of space and allow it to move away on its\nown. If it appears aggressive or is acting strangely, contact your local animal control or wildlife agency.\nDo bobcats mate for life?\nBobcats are generally solitary animals and do not mate for life. The males and females come together\nonly during the breeding season.\nAre bobcats protected?\nBobcats are not protected at the federal level in the United States, but they are subject to hunting and\ntrapping regulations in many states. It’s essential to check local regulations before hunting or trapping\nbobcats.\nHow big do bobcats get?\nAdult bobcats typically weigh between 13 and 40 pounds and stand about 12 to 24 inches tall at the\nshoulder. Males are generally larger than females.\nWhat is the gestation period for bobcats?\nThe gestation period for bobcats is approximately 50 to 70 days. They typically have one to six kittens\nper litter.\nHow important are bobcats to the ecosystem?\nBobcats play an important role in the ecosystem by controlling populations of rodents and other small\nanimals. They help to maintain the balance of the food chain.\nIs A bobcat rare in my backyard?\nWhile the general consensus regarding the query, “Is A bobcat rare?” suggests they are not, that\ndoesn’t mean they are common in all areas. Bobcats are naturally shy and elusive creatures.\nTherefore, it is still fairly unlikely that you will see one in your backyard. They are much more likely to be\nactive in less populated and more natural settings."}

(AP Photo/Ashley Landis)\nNew England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye (10) speaks after the AFC Championship NFL football\ngame against the Denver Broncos, Sunday, Jan. 25, 2026, in Denver. (AP Photo/Ashley Landis)\nThere’s something about second-year New England Patriots quarterbacks and playoff games in the\nsnow.\nIn the 2001 season, Tom Brady and New England were trailing the Oakland Raiders late in the\ndivisional round of his first-ever playoff game, when he had an apparent fumble wiped away by the\nthen-little known — and since-abolished — “ Tuck Rule.”\nBrady took advantage of his second chance and guided the Patriots into field-goal position for Adam\nVinatieri to tie the game, then drove New England to the winning kick in overtime to ignite the\nfranchise’s run to its first Super Bowl title.\nIn Sunday’s AFC championship game, it was 23-year-old Drake Maye’s turn when he scored the\nPatriots’ only touchdown on a 6-yard run in their 10-7 win over the Denver Broncos in snowy conditions\nto send them back to the title game for the first time since the 2018 season.\nNext is a trip to Santa Clara, California, for a Super Bowl 49 rematch against the Seattle Seahawks and\na chance to put a cap on an improbable one-year turnaround in their first season under coach Mike\nVrabel. The Patriots (17-3) are just the sixth team to reach a Super Bowl after winning five or fewer\ngames in the previous season (4-13).\n“I think that’s why you actually do this. You have to believe things, and sometimes before you can see\nthem,\" Vrabel said.\nIt’ll be a familiar venue for Maye, a North Carolina native, who attended Super Bowl 50 in Santa Clara\nas a spectator with his father. Maye’s cheers couldn’t lift Cam Newton and the Carolina Panthers to a\nvictory that day.\nBut 10 years later, he’ll be back with his own opportunity to raise the Lombardi Trophy.\n“Pretty cool to be full circle, going back here 10 years later, and I think it’s just a special moment for this\nwhole team,” Maye said.\nMaye called Sunday’s win “gritty” and continually praised his teammates after the MVP candidate\ncompleted just 10 of 21 passes for a season-low 86 yards. But he was backed by a defense that didn’t\nallow a point in 10 straight drives after allowing a first-quarter touchdown to Broncos backup\nquarterback Jarrett Stidham.\nIt helped New England earn its first playoff victory in Denver after losing its previous four attempts.\n“The history and everything about it, it’s a new team, it’s a new era,” Maye said. “I respect and\nappreciate what the Patriots dynasty did, and unfortunately, they didn’t come out with some wins here,\nbut we changed that narrative and look forward to bringing our best football to Santa Clara. That’ll be\npretty special.”\nNew England continues to thrive on the road and improved to 9-0 away from Massachusetts this\nseason.\nThe inclement weather certainly played a role in the Patriots’ low-scoring output Sunday. But 10 points\nand 3.2 yards per play won’t cut it in the Super Bowl opposite a Seahawks team that is averaging 36\npoints per game in the playoffs.\n“It’s hard to find ways to win, especially in the postseason,” wide receiver Stefon Diggs said. “It’s never\ngoing to look good. It ended up 10-7 this week. The object of the game is to score more than the\nopponents.\"\nThe Patriots defense. The 26 points the Patriots have allowed this postseason are the fewest in a\nthree-game playoff span since the 2000 Ravens allowed 23 during their Super Bowl-winning run.\nNew England has also held opponents to just 209.7 yards per game while getting 12 sacks and forcing\n12 turnovers.\nOffensive line. Maye was sacked five times against the Broncos, bringing his total to 15 through three\nplayoff games. That’s more than any other quarterback this postseason.\nLinebacker Robert Spillane left in the first quarter with an ankle issue.\n1 — Maye is the first quarterback in NFL history to win three playoff games against top five total\ndefenses in a single postseason (Chargers fifth, Texans first, Broncos second).\nThe Patriots will play for the franchise’s seventh Super Bowl win, which would break a tie with the\nPittsburgh Steelers for the most in NFL history.\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL"}

But Shedeur Sanders’\nselection may have finally pushed that debate into the open...\n\nThe NFL’s Pro Bowl has long walked the line between merit and marketability. But Shedeur Sanders’\nselection may have finally pushed that debate into the open. After being named to the AFC Pro Bowl\nroster following a wave of injuries and declined invitations, Sanders’ inclusion quickly drew backlash\nfrom fans and players alike.\nAmong the loudest critics was New York Giants offensive tackle Jermaine Eluemunor, who dismissed\nthe honor outright and suggested the event has become more about name recognition than on-field\nperformance.\n“Andrew Thomas, top LT in the NFL, hasn’t made one yet. But if you’re popular, you get in. Laughable\nat this point,” he tweeted.\nSanders’ rookie year in Cleveland was undeniably complicated. Drafted in the fifth round of the 2025\nNFL Draft, he opened the season as the Browns’ third-string quarterback. A Joe Flacco trade and a\nseason-ending injury to rookie Dillon Gabriel eventually forced Sanders into action. And to his credit, he\nseized the moment early.\nHe snapped a 20-year Browns curse by winning his first career start, an iconic moment that briefly\nelectrified the fanbase. From there, Sanders retained the starting job for the remainder of the season.\nStill, the overall body of work was uneven.\nSanders threw for 1,400 yards, seven touchdowns, and 10 interceptions, while adding 169 rushing\nyards. Any sign of progress often came with a setback. An unforced error, a rushed decision, or a\nmoment of panic that resulted in a costly turnover. Statistically and on tape, there was “objectively more\nbad than good,” even by rookie standards.\nThat’s what made the Pro Bowl nod so jarring to many observers. Some fans saw Eluemunor’s\ncomments as unnecessary bitterness:\n“Sounds like hate. Nobody said anything before.”\nWhile others felt he simply said what many were already thinking:\n“He’s not wrong. The Pro Bowl used to be the NFL’s All-Star Game—now it’s a popularity contest.”\n“He’s 1000% right.”\n“I love Shedeur, but he’s not lying. No way he should’ve made it with those stats.”\n■■■■■■■■: Following the news of Shedeur Sanders making the Pro Bowl, Giants OT Jermaine\nEluemunor says the Pro Bowl has become “a joke” “Andrew Thomas Top LT in the NFL hasn't made\none yet but if you're popular you get in. Laughable at this point” https://t.co/eGCx3Y2hvO\npic.twitter.com/tkqnAgajfV — JPA (@jasrifootball) January 26, 2026\nOne fan even questioned the replacement logic entirely:\n“Definitely were better choices for Drake Maye’s replacement. Same thing with Zay Flowers being\nnamed a Pro Bowler this year.”\nDespite the controversy, the Pro Bowl offers Sanders one valuable thing: momentum. With Cleveland\nentering yet another coaching search, his future hinges almost entirely on who takes over.\nWhat’s next for Shedeur?\nIf the incoming coach views Sanders the way scouts once did, this could become a redemption arc. But\nthe opposite outcome is just as plausible.\nIf the new staff isn’t sold, Sanders could easily join the long list of young quarterbacks who start early,\nlose organizational backing, and drift into journeyman territory. Or out of the league altogether. For\nnow, though, he’ll suit up for the Pro Bowl.\nAnd as controversial as his selection may be, Sanders can take solace in one recent reminder: Sam\nDarnold, once written off as a bust, rebuilt his career and is now leading the Seattle Seahawks into the\nSuper Bowl."}

The outspoken media personalit\n\nBarstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy is no stranger to bold moves, but his latest NFL wager may be\none of the most talked-about bets of his career.\nThe outspoken media personality and lifelong New England Patriots fan recently revealed that he\nplaced a $50,000 futures bet on the Patriots to win Super Bowl 60, a gamble that could return a\nstaggering $1.8 million payout if the team completes its unlikely championship run.\nDave Portnoy reveals massive Super Bowl LX bet\nPortnoy locked in the wager earlier in the season when expectations around New England were modest\nat best. At the time, the Patriots were considered a longshot contender, reflected by odds north of\n+3000.\nWhat initially looked like a high-risk play driven by fandom has since transformed into a potentially\nmassive payday as the Patriots navigated a surprising path to the NFL's biggest stage.\nThroughout the season, Portnoy has openly discussed the bet across social media, embracing both the\npressure and excitement that comes with having so much riding on one game.\nHis transparency has drawn attention not only from Patriots fans but also from bettors fascinated by\nhow a single futures ticket can balloon in value when circumstances align perfectly.\nThe Patriots' journey to Super Bowl 60 has been defined by resilience. After an uneven start, New\nEngland caught fire later in the season, finishing strong and grinding out hard-fought playoff victories.\nTheir AFC Championship win over Denver was emblematic of that run, a defensive struggle that\nshowcased discipline and timely execution when it mattered most.\nSymbol of faith and betting culture\nAs legalized sports betting continues to expand, high-profile figures like Portnoy have become symbols\nof how fans engage with the game on a deeper financial level. His bet shows both loyalty to his team\nand confidence in a franchise he believes is on the rise again.\nThe Patriots now face a formidable challenge in Super Bowl 60, where they will square off against a\nSeattle Seahawks team favored by oddsmakers.

This matchup brings back\nmemories of their legendary 2015 battle, which the Patriots won to secure their fourth title. During FOX\nNFL coverage, former star Rob Gronkowski noted that the 2015 victory launched the team’s second\ndynasty and announced aloud to the 31 NFL teams if this upcoming game could mark the beginning of\na third.\nWatch What’s Trending Now!\n“And this is going to be a rematch.

Meanwhile, the\nSeahawks are also fighting to win their first title since 2014.\nBut it is also to be noted that this year’s journey to the championship has been famously unpredictable,\nwith many experts noting that no single team has dominated the entire season. While legends like Rob\nGronkowski have high hopes for a new Patriots dynasty, the outcome remains a mystery.\nBecause the games have been so competitive and full of surprises, we won’t know for sure which team\nwill start a new era of dominance until the final whistle blows at Super Bowl LX in February 2026.\nRead Top Stories First From EssentiallySports Click here and check box next to EssentiallySports\nDrake Maye leads the Patriots to Super Bowl LX\nIn a snowy and freezing AFC Championship Game, the New England Patriots leaned on Drake Maye’s\nlegs rather than his arm to secure a 10-7 victory over the Denver Broncos. Facing a fierce defense and\na field turning white with snow, Maye struggled to find his rhythm in the air, throwing for only 86 yards.\nHowever, Maye pushed through all the hurdles, turning himself into a dual-threat playmaker when it\nmattered most, rushing for 65 yards and scoring the team’s only touchdown to lead the Patriots to\nSuper Bowl LX. At 2:10 of the second quarter, after a sack-fumble recovery at Denver’s 12-yard line,\nMaye punched it in on a 6-yard rush to tie the game, giving New England the short field that swung\nmomentum.\n“We were running the football and protecting the football,” said Maye, who piloted the Patriots to a\nfield-goal drive to begin the second half. “Once we got those three points out of halftime, that was a\nhuge drive. Just protect the football and let our defense keep doing their thing.” He said, looking back at\nthe victorious game they played against the Broncos.\nNew England’s defense and Denver’s pressure on Maye defined the day: Maye was sacked five times\nfor a loss of 21 yards, which helps explain why the Patriots had to rely on his legs in crunch time. Andy\nBorregales made a 23-yard field goal but missed attempts from 46 and 63 yards in the snowy\nconditions; those misses, along with Denver’s own missed 54-yarder, kept the final score low.\nAfter leading a crucial field-goal drive to start the second half, Maye focused on playing mistake-free\nfootball and letting his defense control the game. While the Patriots’ top receivers were mostly shut\ndown by the Broncos’ secondary, veteran Mack Hollins provided a much-needed spark with two big\ncatches.\nJarrett Stidham’s pass intended for Marvin Mims was intercepted by Christian González at the New\nEngland 36 with 2:18 remaining in the fourth quarter. The turnover handed the Pats the ball and\nallowed them to run out the clock.\nWith the game on the line, the Patriots faced a critical third down. Rather than playing it safe with a\nhandoff, offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels trusted Maye to make a play himself. On 3rd-and-5 from\nNew England’s 41, with 1:57 left on the clock, Maye ran a naked bootleg for a 7-yard gain to pick up the\nfirst down. The conversion allowed the Patriots to kneel and seal the 10–7 win.\nThis final scramble allowed the Patriots to run out the clock and officially punch their ticket to the\nchampionship."}

It was the fifth Quad 1\nwin of the season for coach Jan Jensen’s team, which has the look of a real contender.\nBut on the other hand, Iowa played most of the game without starting sharpshooter Taylor McCabe,\nwho played less than 30 seconds before going down with a non-contact injury. On Monday, Iowa’s\nworst fears were confirmed: McCabe will need season-ending surgery after suffering an ACL tear in her\nleft knee.\n“This isn’t how I imagined my senior season ending, but adversity has always been part of the game,”\nMcCabe said in a statement. “I’m committed to my recovery and to supporting my teammates in every\nway I can for the rest of this season. I’m grateful for the love and encouragement from my coaches,\nteammates, and everyone who has been with me throughout this journey at the University of Iowa.”\nMcCabe, who is a senior, will go down as one of the top 3-point shooters in program history. She made\n40.7% of her 3s in her career, tied with Kristi Smith for the best in Iowa history. She attempted 423\n3-pointers, compared to 33 2-pointers in four seasons.\nMcCabe was averaging 8.1 points, 3.5 rebounds and 2.3 assists a game this season. In Iowa’s win last\nThursday at Maryland, McCabe sank four 3-pointers and grabbed five rebounds.\nSunday was an all-around bummer for the McCabe family. Taylor’s sister Peyton — who plays at Drake\n— exited the Bulldogs’ loss to Murray State on Sunday after suffering an apparent ankle injury. The\nsophomore guard fell awkwardly at the end of the first half and had to be carried off the floor. Drake\nhasn’t issued a statement about her status.\nHigh Point could bust your bracket\nThere are a few well-established mid-major powers in women’s college basketball. Teams that\nregularly make the NCAA Tournament, occasionally win games and often take down Power 4\nopponents in non-conference play.\nBefore departing for the Dallas Wings, Jose Fernandez built USF into one of these programs. Aaron\nJohnston has molded South Dakota State into a dominant Summit League team over his lengthy\ntenure. Lisa Fortier has done it at Gonzaga. Carly Thibault-DuDonis seems on her way to turning\nFairfield into one, too.\nChelsea Banbury came from one of these types of programs — Florida Gulf Coast. As a player and\nthen assistant coach for 11 seasons, she got an up close look at how Karl Smesko built the Eagles into\na program that no opponent wanted to see in the NCAA Tournament.\nBefore leaving in 2024 to coach the Atlanta Dream, Smesko built FGCU into a team that went to the\nNCAA Tournament in 10 of his final 13 seasons, and won their opening round game four times.\nSmesko had opportunities to leave for a richer program in a bigger conference, but stayed at FGCU\nand made them into the David that regularly slayed Goliaths.\nNow, Banbury is trying to build her own version of a mid-major power in North Carolina. She’s been the\nhead coach at High Point since 2019 and won 63.6% of her games. Her tenure has been highlighted by\nthree regular season Big South titles and the program’s first two trips to the NCAA Tournament in 2021\nand 2025.\nAnd it seems like she’s staying at High Point. Ahead of last season’s NCAA Tournament, she agreed to\na contract extension before the coaching carousel ramped up.\n“Honestly, this university, there’s not many like it, especially at the mid-major level,” Banbury told USA\nToday Sports. “I am a firm believer of the grass isn’t always greener on the other side just for a\npaycheck. I did work for Karl Smesko. He stayed at FGCU and he made it his own, and made it into\nsomething that everybody recognizes. And I do see that in High Point. I think it can be a special place. I\nthink it's somewhere that you can build something pretty incredible.”\nBanbury should have the resources to keep raising the bar at High Point. It’s one of five Big South\nprograms that opted into the House Settlement, allowing them to share revenue directly with athletes.\nAnd with no football team, that leaves more funds for basketball.\nSo far this season, Banbury’s Panthers are 18-2 with their only losses coming at Houston and\nDavidson. All but three of their wins this season have been by double figures. High Point is excelling on\nboth ends of the floor, ranking 28th nationally in effective field goal percentage (52.1) and 11th in points\nallowed per play (0.68). Macy Spencer, a transfer from UNLV who leads the Panthers in scoring with\n18.9 points per game, ranks 10th nationally in 3-pointers made per game with 3.1.\nPut more simply: High Point is a team capable of pulling off a first round upset in the NCAA\nTournament. They’re dominating in the Big South, they nearly escaped non-conference play\nunscathed, and the Panthers have what it takes to bust brackets in March.\n“That’s definitely our goal going into every year and we try to recruit a team and maintain a team that\nwe think can make that happen. We try to bring players in that can do that and I think that’s what we’ve\ndone,” Banbury said.\nKeep an eye on the Panthers as March Madness draws closer.\nWinter weather impact\nIf Duke women’s basketball coach Kara Lawson and N.C. State men’s basketball coach Will Wade\nshare something in common, they had the chance to talk about it on Saturday.\nDue to the impact of Winter Storm Fern — and because Duke and N.C. State were flying out of the\nsame airport and playing in the same arena on Saturday — Lawson’s Blue Devils and Wade’s\nWolfpack shared a charter flight to Pittsburgh.\nBoth Duke and N.C. State left Pitt with victories, and the shared flight was one of the many ways the\nwinter storm that blanketed much of the East Coast affected college basketball this past weekend.\nElsewhere in North Carolina’s Research Triangle, the UNC men and N.C. State women also\nconsidered sharing a chartered flight to Charlottesville, Virginia, but both wound up taking buses\ninstead.\nGames were moved around and rescheduled. Some were closed off to fans, and others had smaller TV\ncrews working the game. The clash between UNC and Syracuse played on Sunday in Chapel Hill on\nACC Network Xtra was presented with no broadcast team and a single camera panning back and forth\nacross the court at Carmichael Arena. Fans that still tuned in — and perhaps synced up the stream with\nthe radio call from UNC’s Matt Krause — saw the Tar Heels win in overtime behind 21 points and 11\nrebounds from Nyla Harris.\nTwo games of consequence were pushed back.\nGeorge Mason was set to host Richmond on Sunday in a battle between two of the top three teams in\nthe Atlantic 10, but the game was rescheduled for Feb. 16.\nIn the SEC, Ole Miss was supposed to travel to Tennessee on Monday night, but the game has been\npostponed and a new date has yet to be set. While the Rebels have an open bye date on their schedule\n— Sunday, Feb. 8 — the Volunteers do not because they used their baked-in open date in SEC play to\nschedule UConn in a non-conference clash.\nTip-ins"}

The beginning of the end of Tua’s career was\nwhen he got benched and now with a new GM and HC the fat lady is done singing. Even Tua knows his\ncareer in Miami is over as he has sold his home in Davie.\nThe million-dollar question is how the Dolphins are going to get him off the books. I would not trade for\nhim if I was a GM and his salary makes it even more difficult unless Tua takes a pay cut. Not only do\nthe Dolphins know that he is not a franchise QB, but other teams do as well. A stop gap or backup at\nbest.\nZach Wilson is a gonner as well and will not be resigned. He is what he is, a first round bust that can’t\neven be counted on as a backup.\nSully has already confirmed that he will not build the team with a bunch of free agent mercenaries,\nhowever QB is the most important position in all of sports. This is where rumors of the Dolphins signing\nMalik Willis comes in.\nA lot of folks on here are not thrilled about Willis, however the Dolphins should absolutely try and sign\nWillis if he is affordable although there will be a bidding war for his services. He is still in his prime at 26,\nplayed very well filling in for Love and showcased that he has possible big upside.\nWillis is a dual threat with good arm strength, and the Dolphins can win with him behind center. Willis\nwould be an upgrade, and defenses would have to game plan against his mobility giving the Dolphins\noffense another aspect for opponents to be concerned about. A poor man’s Lamar Jackson.\nHere are his stats in limited starts the last two seasons with the Packers.

FSU finishes the season with back-to-back home games vs. NC State and Florida.\nA road trip to Alabama is set for Sept. 19.\nWhile 12 ACC teams will play a nine-game conference schedule, FSU is one of five schools that will\nplay eight conference games. Starting in 2027, 16 teams will play a nine-game ACC schedule, with one\nteam each year playing eight games but required to schedule two Power Four opponents to reach the\n10 Power 4 game requirement.\nComing off a disappointing 5-7 season, which started with promise after a win over Alabama and a 3-0\nstart to the season, the Seminoles retooled their roster in the portal and through prep recruitment.\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\nFor the third season, the Seminoles will have a new starting quarterback, expected to be Auburn\ntransfer Ashton Daniels, though returning rising sophomore Kevin Sperry is waiting in the wings.\nWhichever quarterback starts, they'll have a returning Duce Robinson to target, after he spurned the\nNFL draft for a final season in Tallahassee, alongside speedstar Micahi Danzy.\nOn the defensive side of the ball, the Desir twins are expected to build upon a phenomenal freshman\ncampaign and help lead the front seven in Tony White's second season as the defensive coordinator. A\npair of freshmen in linebacker Izayia Williams and defensive back Chauncey \"Chuck\" Kennon are both\npotential instant impact players.\nIn total, the Seminoles brought in 56 new players through the transfer portal and prep recruitment, so\nwill that be enough to spark a program that has won just seven games in two seasons? Time will tell,\nbut for now, here is our way-too-early season prediction.\nFlorida State football game-by-game win/loss prediction\nvs. New Mexico State | Aug. 29 - Win 34-10\nvs. SMU* | Sept. 7 - Loss 28-21\nBye\nat Alabama | Sept. 19 - Loss 31-17\nvs. Central Arkansas | Sept. 26 - Win 56-13\nvs. Virginia* | Oct. 3 - Win 34-27\nat Louisville* | Oct. 9 - Loss 24-21\nat Miami* | Oct. 17 - Loss 28-17\nBye\nvs. Clemson* | Oct. 31 - Loss 24-14\nat Boston College* | Nov. 7 - Win 42-14\nat Pittsburgh* | Nov. 13 - Win 35-24\nvs. NC State* | Nov. 21 - Win 34-17\nvs. Florida | Nov. 28 - Loss 31-24\nFinal way too early record prediction: 6-6\nThe record is an improvement over the last two seasons, albeit by the slightest of margins, and still far\noff the standard of the program. It would be one win short of the win total of the last two seasons, but is\nit enough for Mike Norvell to save his job and turn the support of the program around? That's a question\nthat will have to be answered by those in high places, but it won't make any of the noise around the\nprogram get any quieter. It's only January; there are seven months before the Seminoles kickoff against\nNew Mexico State in week one, so things can and will change, as is the nature of college football.\nThere are winnable swing games against SMU, Lousiville and Virginia, but will the Seminoles be in\nposition to capitalize on them consistently? Recent seasons suggest no, but this is once again a new\nteam that can change perceptions with convincing wins. October is the hardest portion of the schedule,\nwith games against Miami and Clemson alongside Virginia and Louisville.\nWith the current roster construction, the ceiling for the program likely sits around eight-to-nine wins,\nright now, with a floor of a potential second straight five-win season.

Campbell has already hired a new offensive coordinator. But that’s not all. Now, the Lions have\nbrought in even more help for the offense.\nOn Monday, NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reported that the Lions have hired former NFL quarterback\nMike Kafka to the coaching staff as a “high-ranking offensive assistant.” Though his official title has not\nyet been revealed.\nKafka has been a rapid riser up the coaching ranks since his NFL playing career ended after the 2015\nseason. He began as a graduate assistant with Northwestern in 2016. A year later, Kafka landed a job\nwith the Kansas City Chiefs as an offensive quality control coach.\nIn 2018, Kafka was promoted to quarterbacks coach, a position he held through 2019. In 2020, the\nChiefs added the title of passing game coordinator to Kafka’s duties. He held that role for two seasons\ntoo.\nAs for Detroit, it’s a good landing spot for the former NFL QB who spent the past four seasons as the\nNew York Giants’ offensive coordinator. While Kafka ended the season as New York’s interim head\ncoach, John Harbaugh has since landed the job on a full-time basis.\nIf the Lions’ offense can bounce back, Kafka, 38, is a good bet to receive a promotion next offseason.\nWhether that is with Detroit or with another organization remains to be seen, but first, he has to excel in\nhis new position.\nRelated: NFL Power Rankings Before the Super Bowl: Top 2026 NFL Draft Target for Each Team"}

His name is Riq Woolen, and he (perhaps more than anyone on the team) is thankful the\nSeahawks ended up winning the NFC Championship... otherwise he would have gone down as an\nall-time Seattle sports pariah.\nLate in the third quarter, the Seahawks were leading 31-20 and just stopped the Rams' high-powered\noffense. Matthew Stafford had his unit moving with ease on Mike Macdonald's vaunted defense, but\nhad just thrown an incompletion on 3rd-and-12 at Seattle's 49-yard line. The Rams were on the verge\nof punting the ball away, which would have likely meant they would've been down 11-points going into\nthe fourth quarter.\nInstead, a late taunting flag was called on Riq Woolen. Suddenly, the Rams were gifted fifteen more\nyards and a new first down. One play later, Stafford found Puka Nacua for a 34-yard touchdown strike\nto make it a 31-27 game. This could have easily been a truly disastrous turning point in the game for\nSeattle. Fortunately, the Seahawks' defense made a heroic stop on 4th down later in the game, while\nSam Darnold drained the clock to punch their ticket to the Super Bowl.\nAfter the game, Woolen went on Twitter and posted a rather cheeky apology.\nFor all the frustration Woolen can bring, he does seem like a solid young man with the right attitude. He\nmade a mistake (a deeply costly one) and he's acknowledging it. The mentality of this Seahawks team\nis not letting bad plays or moments define players. After the game, head coach Mike Macdonald spoke\ndirectly about Woolen and the taunting penalty.\nExpert NFL picks: Exclusive betting insights only at USA TODAY.\n\"Look, Riq has done a tremendous job for us,\" said Macdonald. \"Yeah, you're frustrated in the moment\nabout what's happening, but he just made an emotional decision and we got to pick him up. That's not\nthe time to point, get all upset. You've got to play the next play and score and go rebound back and go\nback. Riq came back and played well the rest of the game. So I mean, it literally is like \"12 As One.\"\nJust keep picking each other up.\"\nWoolen has two weeks to become reacquainted with the league's anti-taunting penalty, because a\nsimilar mistake won't be as tolerated in the Super Bowl."}

He had spent the first part of his career\nwith the San Francisco 49ers, making a name for himself as one of the top defensive enforcers in the\nleague. That was perfect, because it was exactly what the Broncos' defense needed at the interior\nlinebacker position.\nGreenlaw wasn't terrible for the Broncos this season. He made somewhat of an impact when he was on\nthe field, racking up 43 tackles, one sack, one interception and one forced fumble. The bigger issue\nwas that he wasn't on the field enough, playing in 10 of 18 games, counting the postseason.\nBut when he was on the field, many expected him to be much more of a force. When addressing the\nmedia on Monday, less than 24 hours after the Broncos' season came to an end in the AFC\nChampionship Game, Greenlaw explained that the transition from what he was used to in San\nFrancisco to what he came to in Denver was much more difficult than he expected.\nDre Greenlaw said Sean Payton is an old school coach and that learning the defensive playbook was\nlike Spanish pic.twitter.com/rZ0NVusYX4 — Zac Stevens (@ZacStevensDNVR) January 26, 2026\n\"It's just two different personalities in coaches.

Shanahan, he's the complete opposite. He's more of a... he wants\nyou fresh, ya know what I mean? So it's just two completely different mindsets and they both have their\nway of doing things and it's for good reasons, too. But just having that understanding of things,\nunderstanding of the defense, I mean that was, ya know, like freaking Spanish when I first saw it\".\nThat admission made by Greenlaw, that reading the defensive playbook was like learning a foreign\nlanguage, is something many players wouldn't do. Greenlaw, explaining the differences between the\ntwo organizations he has played for, shows how difficult it is to be successful consistently in the NFL.\nIt's not a matter of just signing great players as free agents, plugging them into your system and they're\ninstantly a perfect fit.\nREAD: Broncos will have huge decision to make at running back this offseason\nGreenlaw will be a player the Broncos hope can not only stay healthy next season, but also have a\nbigger impact when he's out on the field, having a full season to adapt to his new surroundings, which\nare apparently much different than what he was used to.\nMore Broncos Content\nWhich Broncos players are set to become unrestricted free agents?\n4 Broncos players who may have just played their final game with team\nBroncos have a silver lining despite loss in AFC Championship Game\nWhere should the blame go after Broncos drop AFC Championship Game to Patriots?\n4 things Denver Broncos must do in order to beat Patriots in AFC Championship Game"}

Mispronunciations can occur. We\nare working with our partners to continually review and improve the results.\nFive games played, only two goals against and a whopping 46 goals for.\nThat’s the stat line for the Canadian women who won Olympic hockey gold in Turin, Italy in 2006.\nThat Canadian team had it all. There was the star power of Hockey Hall of Famer Hayley Wickenheiser,\nwho scored 17 points in just five games. Her single-tournament points record wasn’t eclipsed until\n2022, when Sarah Nurse broke the record.\nBehind the scoring, there was smothering defence, and two bonafide starting goaltenders to choose\nfrom in Quebeckers Kim St-Pierre and Charline Labonté.\nThere was also a strong core of leaders, including the captain, Cassie Campbell-Pascall, the\nunderrated Vicky Sunohara, and many others in between.\nFor the first, and only time, the gold medal match-up featured a non-North American team. Canada\ndefeated Sweden 4-1 to win a second consecutive Olympic championship.\nSome have argued the Canadians didn’t face stiff competition on their way to gold, since they never\nplayed the Americans.\nThe Canadians allowed only two goals on the way to winning gold at the 2006 Olympics in Turin, Italy.\n(Julie Jacobson/The Associated Press)\nBut Cheryl Pounder, a defender on that team and a TSN hockey analyst, disagreed.\n“Whether we had played the United States or Sweden, I do believe we would have been successful,”\nPounder said.\nAs the Olympics return to Italy for Milano-Cortina 2026, two decades after the Games in Turin, CBC\nSports gathered interviews with members of the 2006 Canadian team over the last year.\nOne word came up often: dominant.\n“It was the greatest team that I've ever been a part of,” Pounder said.\nA mix of rookies and veterans\nThe Canadians went into the Olympics in Turin in a much different position than in 2002, when they\nwere underdogs.\nIn those Games, Canada won the country’s first Olympic championship. They followed it up with a\nworld championship in 2004 in Halifax.\nThe 2006 roster was filled with a mix of veterans from that 2002 team, including Campbell-Pascall,\nWickenheiser, St-Pierre, Sunohara, Cherie Piper and Becky Kellar, to name a few.\nThere were also up-and-coming young players, like Meghan Agosta, who turned 19 during the\ntournament.\n“It was probably one of the best Canadian teams on paper,” Ouellette said last year. “We had an\nincredible mix of young players and veterans. We had an incredible season, dominating from start to\nfinish. That didn't mean that it was easier. Our coaches really prepared us well. They prepared us the\nhard way.”\nOuellette, a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame who’s now an assistant coach on the Canadian team\nshe once played on, said she learned a lot about leadership that season from players like\nCampbell-Pascall and Sunohara.\nCanadian players (left to right) Sarah Vaillancourt, Kim St-Pierre, Gina Kingsbury, Charline Labonté\nand Caroline Ouellette celebrate with their Olympic gold medals in 2006. (Ian Barrett/The Canadian\nPress)\nGina Kingsbury was a wide-eyed rookie who was eager to soak up wisdom in her first Olympics, after\nbeing cut from the 2002 team.\nTwenty years later, the experience of being at the Olympics is more fresh in her mind than the games\nshe played.\n“It was just everything else that was just grandiose for me,” Kingsbury said last year. “I remember the\nopening ceremonies and how I felt becoming officially an Olympian.”\nLike Ouellette, Kingsbury will be heading to Milano-Cortina 2026 as a member of Team Canada. She's\nthe general manager of the national women's team.\n“I thought we were one of the best teams I think Canada has put on the ice,” Kingsbury said. “We were\nyoung and eager, and we never got a chance to play the U.S. in the final game. But I thought we were a\ndominant team.”\nConnected on the ice\nCanada floated through the preliminary round, defeating Italy, Russia and Sweden easily.\nIn the semifinals, Canada shut out the Finns, 6-0.\nPart of the success came from a team that carried over valuable lessons from 2002. Every player knew\ntheir role and played it, Pounder said.\n“You have the selflessness of Vicky Sunohara, who was the glue between the top line and someone\nwho may play a few minutes,” she said. “There was the great Cassie Campbell-Pascall, who wore the\ncaptaincy and wasn't afraid to push the buttons at the right time. And then of course, the Hayley\nWickenheisers, the Cherie Pipers of the world.”\nOn the back end, the Canadians only brought five defenders to play in Italy because Ouellette could\nplay both forward and defence. Pounder and Kellar formed a shutdown pair.\n“We were always together, connected in every zone, and it just carried us forward right from the\ndefensive end, right through the neutral zone into the offensive zone,” Pounder said. “Every piece of the\npuzzle just wanted to do their role to the best of their ability, knowing what their strengths were.”\nA Swedish brick wall\nThe Canadian team was talented. But you can’t talk about the 2006 Olympics without talking about Kim\nMartin Hasson.\nSwedish goaltender Kim Martin Hasson stood on her head for the Swedes, all the way to a spot in the\nOlympic final. (Eric Risberg/The Associated Press)\nThe 19-year-old Swedish goaltender was a big part of why her team was able to upset the Americans in\nthe semifinals. She made 37 saves in the win, and was later named the tournament's top goaltender.\n\"She was outstanding,\" Kingsbury said.\nThe Swedes had been down 2-0 before two goals from Maria Rooth tied it. She added another goal in\nthe shootout en route to Sweden’s first appearance in the gold medal game.\nThe Canadian team was set to play its semifinal after the Sweden-U.S. game, and Kingsbury\nremembered the players being glued to the game. They didn't want to look away to warm up.\n“It's like, oh my God, are the Americans actually going to lose?” Kingsbury said. “[Martin Hasson] stood\non her head that game. You had Maria Rooth and you had Erika Holst and you had a really great\nSwedish team that year. It was pretty exciting and definitely unorthodox to not have the Americans in\nthe gold medal game.”\nOutside North America, it was a breakthrough and a sign of the growth of the game since it had made\nits Olympic debut in 1998. It's something Wickenheiser described years later as “a great thing for\nwomen’s hockey.”\nBut in the final, Canadians found a way to beat the talented Swedish teenager, winning that game, 4-1.\nA first-period goal from Ouellette held up as the winner, and the Swedes managed only eight shots on\ngoal.\n“I think that it probably was one of the best teams we’ve ever iced,” Wickenheiser said. “Just some\ngreat players, a lot of depth. We really seemed to dominate that Olympics.”\nIn Pounder’s mind, the team just had something special that's hard to replicate.\n“Every once in a while you get just so fortunate to be part of a group that's bigger than yourself and you\ndon't know how you got there,” Pounder said. “I think we'd all be GMs and we’d be making a jillion\ndollars if we had the special sauce that we could bottle. But to me, we just had it. We won together, and\nit’s moment I'll never forget.”\nTwenty years later, the Canadians return to Italy as Olympic champions, looking to repeat at the top of\nthe podium. And this time around, there might be less surprise to see a European team like rising\nCzechia or steady Finland break through to the gold medal game. Thanks to the PWHL, several stars\non those teams play regularly with the best from North America.\nCanada begins its tournament on Feb. 5 against Finland."}

I feel like when people say that they can't do something,\nthey prove them wrong.\"\n\nJrue Holiday, whose arrival in 2023 helped push the Celtics over the championship hump, returned to\nTD Garden on Monday for the first time since his offseason trade to Portland.\nCeltics head coach Joe Mazzulla raved about the unselfish mindset Holiday brought to Boston’s locker\nroom during his two seasons with the franchise.\n“The biggest thing that stands out is who he is as a person,” Mazzulla said pregame. “You take a look\nat a guy who was a champion and an All-Star, and he comes in and accepts a completely different role\nand does it with a smile on his face, and does it with a level of respect and professionalism and is\nwilling to do what it takes to win every night. … It was great having him for the time that we did.”\nHoliday, who was traded to Portland in exchange for Anfernee Simons, missed nearly two months this\nseason with a calf injury, but he’s been productive for the Trail Blazers when active. The 35-year-old\nguard has a much larger offensive role than he did with the Celtics — with whom he was a defense-first\nplayer — averaging 15.4 points and 7.1 assists over 18 games (16 starts).\n“He’s huge for us,” Blazers interim head coach Tiago Splitter said. “What he brings to the locker room,\nto the court, his experience. He’s taken care of end-of-the-game situations, life situations, locker room\nsituations — all of the things that we preach about as a staff, as an organization, he’s on point with the\nplayers. It’s a pleasure to have him in our locker room.”\nHoliday said he fully expected to be traded given the precarious luxury-tax situation Boston faced last\noffseason — and that he’s “not that surprised” his old team is succeeding without him, Kristaps\nPorzingis, Al Horford, Luke Kornet and the injured Jayson Tatum. Led by Jaylen Brown, an All-Star\nstarter for the first time this season, the Celtics entered Monday with the second-best record in the\nEastern Conference and the third-best net rating in the NBA.\n“I knew that they’d be well, they’d do well, knowing the type of determination that this coaching staff and\norganization has,” Holiday said. “Being with this team for a couple of years now and knowing the type of\nplayers that they are and how to prepare, I figured that they would be good. And then obviously,\nknowing Jaylen, feel like he takes a lot of things personally. He doesn’t accept a lot, especially when it\ncomes to being bad.”\nWhat does Brown take personally?\n“Just losing,” Holiday said. “I think people counted them out as a team. Not just Jaylen. I know Payton\n(Pritchard), Sam (Hauser), Neemi (Queta), Joe, the whole coaching staff — I feel like when people say\nthat they can’t do something, they prove them wrong.”\nTime Lord returns\nHoliday wasn’t the only ex-Celtic facing his former team for the first time Monday night.\nIt also was Robert Williams III’s first game against Boston since the Celtics traded him to Portland 2 1/2\nyears ago to acquire Holiday. The teams had played five times since then, but the oft-injured Williams\ndid not dress for any of those games.\nWilliams is averaging 6.0 points, 6.3 rebounds and 1.3 blocks per game this season as former UConn\ncenter Donovan Clingan’s backup.\n“He’s been huge this year, of course playing more than previous seasons,” Splitter said. “He’s not\nplaying back-to-backs, so we’ve got to be a little careful with him. It’s working so far for us and for him.\nBut he’s big part of our team, just helping our second unit defensively, rebounding, running, setting\nguys open. He’s very important player for us.”\nMinott healthy, two bigs sit\nAn illness hit the Celtics’ locker room during the lead-up to Monday’s game. Big men Luka Garza and\nChris Boucher both were ruled out before tipoff, and starting center Neemias Queta was listed as\nquestionable before being upgraded to available.\nQueta, whose illness first appeared on Boston’s injury report late last week, came off the bench in\nSaturday’s loss to Chicago, with Mazzulla opting to start rookie two-way player Amari Williams in his\nplace.\nOne Celtics reserve made his return to the lineup against Portland: fourth-year wing Josh Minott, who\nwas cleared to play after sitting out 10 straight games with an ankle sprain. Minott has been used as a\nsmall-ball center at times this season, but he fell out of Mazzulla’s rotation before his injury. He’s played\njust three total minutes since Christmas.\nThe Trail Blazers were missing a key piece Monday in potential All-Star Deni Advija, who was ruled out\nwith a back injury.\nPorzingis won’t play\nThe Atlanta Hawks announced Porzingis, who has sat out nine straight games with Achilles tendonitis,\nwill miss at least another week, meaning he’ll be unavailable for what would have been his first game\nback at TD Garden on Wednesday night.\nAs it was during his two seasons in Boston, availability has been an issue for the former Celtics big man\nsince his offseason trade to Atlanta. Porzingis has suited up for just 17 of the Hawks’ 48 games. Before\nhis current Achilles issue, he also dealt with a knee injury and missed 10 consecutive games in\nDecember due to symptoms from the viral illness he contracted late last season. He watched last\nSaturday’s C’s-Hawks game — a 132-106 Boston rout — from the bench in street clothes.\nPorzingis, Holiday and Horford — vital players on Boston’s 2024 championship squad — all have\nplayed in less than 60% of their new teams’ games this season.\nOff the rim\nMazzulla, who visited Patriots training camp last summer and hosted Mike Vrabel at the Celtics’\npractice facility, was asked for his thoughts on the Super Bowl-bound Pats. “I think when you just take a\nlook at it, they’re a team that’s developed an identity over the course of the season,” he said. “And\nevery coach, regardless of the sport, is looking for that — creating that type of identity and consistency,\nand playing to that throughout an entire season. I think they’re a great example of that this year.” …\nStandout rookie Hugo Gonzalez was not selected to participate in the 2026 Rising Stars game, which\nwill be held during All-Star weekend. Boston’s lone representative in the young player showcase will be\ntwo-way wing Ron Harper Jr., who was one of seven designated G League players chosen."}

It gives customers, suppliers, and dealer partners confidence that a carmaker is invested\nin India beyond opportunistic imports, and it aligns with the government’s broader objectives of\nlocalisation, employment and supply-chain development,\" Vinay Piparsania, founder of Millenstrat\nAdvisory and Research, an auto-focused consultancy, said. \"Most European automakers have spent\nyears building local ecosystems, and as market access expands, they are more likely to deepen these\ninvestments rather than retreat from them.\"\nGermany's Mercedes-Benz announced this month that it will begin local assembly of its luxury sports\nutility vehicle (SUV) Maybach GLS in India, making it the only market outside the US to produce the\nvehicle locally. It was joined by peer Volkswagen Cars, which announced that it has rolled out the\nlocally-assembled Tayron R-Line from its plant in Chhattrapati Sambhaji Nagar just a year after its\nglobal launch.\nThe two carmakers will be joined by French Renault which unveiled its new Duster on Monday which\nwill be locally produced. The company has termed India one of its five strategic growth hubs as it began\nits product offensive with Duster SUV which was its best seller in the last decade before it was\ndiscontinued.\nJaguar Land Rover, which manufactures some of its cars in Slovakia, is also set to roll out its first\nvehicle from its parent Tata Motors' new plant in Ranipet, Tamil Nadu, in a month.\nThe European carmakers are doubling down on their plans to increase local assembly and expand\nmanufacturing presence at a time when the India and European Union are on the cusp of signing a free\ntrade agreement (FTA).\nReuters reported, citing sources, that India plans to cut duties on cars imported from the EU to 40%,\nfrom as high as 110% currently. Also, India has agreed to reduce the tax on a limited number of cars\nfrom the 27-nation EU with an import price of more than 15,000 euros, which will be further reduced to\n10% in due course.\nGermany’s BMW plans to launch six new models this year, with most already localised at its Chennai\nplant, which has an annual capacity to produce up to 50,000 units.\nHardeep Singh Brar, chief executive officer (CEO) at BMW, said that the company already relies less\non imports of fully built cars, but the FTA can help broaden the product range.\n\"If customs duties on completely built units are reduced, it would help expand the luxury car market in\nIndia. While CBUs (completely built-up units) currently account for about 5% of our sales, such a\nframework would allow us to broaden our product portfolio, introduce globally popular models and test\nnew offerings,\" he said on the potential impact of the upcoming EU-India FTA.\nPiyush Arora, head of Volkswagen Group India, said the company’s strategy is to develop and produce\ncars that can sell in large numbers domestically, rather than relying on imports.\n“This gives us an opportunity to develop products locally and for that I would still believe that\nirrespective of how the trade agreement evolves, our strategy of local for local would still remain our\nfocus for volume growth,\" Arora told Mint.\nVolkswagen Group has a plant capacity to produce around 200,000 cars in India annually, serving both\nits Skoda and Volkswagen brands.\nThis strategy of betting on local production was reiterated by Mercedes Benz India leadership as they\nunveiled the firm’s plan for 2026. With more than 90% of cars being sold in India already localised\nthrough assembly operations at its plant in Chakan, Mercedes is adding more models to its local\nassembly lineup to reduce prices for customers.\n“We are localizing the Maybach in India. India will be the first market outside of the US to locally\nproduce a GLS Maybach. And this benefit we pass on to customers. So, currently the GLS Maybach is\nat ■3.37 crore, that car comes down to ■2.75 crore,\" Santosh Iyer, managing director and CEO at\nMercedes Benz India, said. Mercedes locally assembles its cars at its Chakan facility with an annual\ncapacity of over 20,000 units.\nThe commitments from the two carmakers come about eight months after Jaguar Land Rover’s\nmanagement reiterated that it is looking to expand the lineup of locally-assembled vehicles after adding\nRange Rover and Range Rover Sport to the Chakan facility, where it can assemble 10,000 vehicles\nannually.\nTata Motors Passenger Vehicles is constructing its new facility in Ranipet, with a total capacity of\n250,000 vehicles per annum, which will be shared with JLR. The first car from this plant was scheduled\nto be rolled out by this month.\n“Most of our models are locally assembled in India at the Pune plant,\" JLR’s chief financial officer\nRichard Molyneux said in May, referring to its Range Rover series during a post-earnings call for the\nJanuary to March period.\n“For Defender, plans are in process to assemble the cars locally,\" he had said then. “We want to tap\ndemand from ultra-high-net-worth individuals in the upcoming years and grow presence in the Indian\nmarket.\"\nRenault India took full ownership of its 480,000-vehicle-per-year plant near Chennai from Nissan in\nMarch last year, as part of its revival strategy in the Indian market. While both Renault and Nissan will\ncontinue producing cars at the facility, the French automaker has assumed greater control of\nmanufacturing operations to bolster its competitiveness in India.\nAs part of its product offensive to take market share, Renault unveiled its brand new Duster model,\nwhich will be built at its plant near Chennai.\n“Today, we are one chef in the kitchen. Everything goes into one person or one power centre, and from\nthere, it gets distributed and then cascades back.

Doug Hall, who still lives in\nScotland, said the idea began when friends in Sioux Falls were watching a game on TV and saw a\ncourt named after a coach at another school.\n“We just kind of looked at each other and said, ‘Why isn’t ours named after Coach Schlimgen?’” Hall\nsaid.\nHe helped coordinate the effort locally, working with alumni to approach the school board.\nHall described Schlimgen as a demanding coach whose approach shaped more than just athletic skill.\n“He was tough on you,” Hall added. “I don’t think anyone would say it was easy. But looking back now,\nyou realize why he coached that way. Sometimes the best moments in life come after the hardest\nmoments.”\nHe added that small towns like Scotland rarely see coaches who build programs as lasting as\nSchlimgen’s.\n“It’s difficult to keep coaches in small towns, and I’m thankful I played in a generation when that was\nmore common,” he said.\nTodd Schlimgen, Tom’s son, said the dedication represented a full-circle moment for the family.\nGrowing up around practices from age seven or eight, Todd watched his father balance coaching,\nteaching, and family life. Although intense at work, Tom separated his professional roles from his family\nlife.\nTom Schlimgen is joined by his wife and their six children during a ceremony honoring him at Scotland\nHigh School. Submitted Photo\n“He didn’t bring it home,” Todd said. “There was coaching time, teaching time, and family time. He was\nintense at work, but when he was home, he was just Dad.”\nTodd played for his father at Scotland High, including on the 1998 team that made the school’s\nfirst-ever state tournament appearance. Later, he spent nine seasons as his father’s assistant at Mount\nMarty University, describing the experience as awesome and inspiring.\nTodd also explained why his father ended up in Scotland. He explained his father loved teaching, but\ncoaching was his true passion.\n“The only reason he moved to Scotland was because it came with the head coach position,” Todd said.\n“He wanted to build a program, and that was the opportunity he had been waiting for.”\nSchlimgen’s career at Scotland High spanned 30 years as head boys basketball coach, compiling a\nrecord of 428-234. His teams won 18 district championships, 16 conference titles, and five regional\nchampionships, producing 18 All-State players and 77 All-Conference selections. He also coached girls\nbasketball for four years, led girls golf to three state medals, assisted on football teams, and directed\nmultiple American Legion and teener baseball teams to championships.\nAfter retiring in 2008, Schlimgen spent a decade at Mount Marty University, leading the women’s\nbasketball program to three national tournaments, including a Fab Four appearance in 2015-16. His\nteams produced six All-Americans and 33 NAIA scholar-athletes, while also earning top academic\nhonors in the NAIA.\nThe dedication drew roughly 60-70 former players, many returning specifically for the event. Casey\nComstock, a former player who spoke at the ceremony, emphasized Schlimgen’s influence beyond\nsports.\n“He turned good players into great ones and great players into great people,” Comstock said, noting the\ncoach taught mental toughness, accountability, integrity, and giving full effort even when no one is\nwatching.\nTom Schlimgen stands with mockup renderings displayed on easels showing what the future Scotland\nHigh School basketball court will look like, including his name painted on the floor, during a dedication\nceremony honoring his legacy. Submitted photo\nTodd said seeing alumni organize the dedication underscored the lasting impact of his father’s\nmentorship.\n“That’s when you realize coaching doesn’t stop when the season ends,” he said. “It carries on long after\nthe games are over.”\nTodd added that growing up around his father shaped his own approach as a teacher and coach,\nblending high expectations with a strong work ethic.\nSchlimgen, a man of few words, did not speak at the ceremony. The brief event focused on mentorship,\ncommunity, and personal growth. The court will officially bear his name when the gym floor is refinished\nthis summer, serving as a permanent reminder of a career built not only on wins and championships\nbut on the life lessons he imparted.\nThough he did not speak during the ceremony, Schlimgen later shared his gratitude for the people who\nshaped his career and family.\n“We have had an incredibly blessed life, surrounded by great coaches, athletes, and community\nsupport,” Schlimgen said. “We are thankful for all those that have held us up over the years.”\nAs the crowd watched the unveiling, former players lingered on the court, sharing memories and\nsnapshots from decades past.\n“Generations of players walked off this court better than they walked on,” Todd said. “That’s the legacy\nof Coach Schlimgen — making people better on the court, in the classroom, and in life.”"}

Reports offered a major\nupdate on Weis's status.\n\nJan. 26, 2026, 6:10 p.m. CT\nLSU football offensive coordinator Charlie Weis won't be leaving Baton Rouge just yet. The rising star's\nname is sure to garner attention in the future, but after a dalliance with the Philadelphia Eagles, Weis\nwill remain with LSU, according to a report from Dianna Russini.\nOn3's Chris Low confirmed the news on Monday night, posting that Weis is \"100 percent committed to\nLSU.\"\nWeis is yet to call a game with the Tigers after leaving Ole Miss for the Tigers, following head coach\nLane Kiffin.\nYoung, innovative offensive minds are a premium asset in the league, and Weis, 32 years old, certainly\nqualifies. His offenses at Ole Miss have been among the best in the country over the past four years,\naveraging more than 35 points per game. He also has the family connection that NFL teams value, as\nhis father spent several years coaching in the league.\nIt feels like a foregone conclusion that Weis will leave for a bigger job sometime in the future. He’s built\nan excellent coaching resume over his short career so far, and that’s expected to continue next season\nat LSU.\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\nWeis and Kiffin did an excellent job of filling out the roster through the transfer portal, highlighted by\nsigning the No. 1 transfer, former Arizona State quarterback Sam Leavitt. If the team they’ve built\nperforms as expected next season, the Eagles will be the first of many NFL teams vying for Weis’\nservices."}

But is it the last time McCutchen has donned the number on the diamond in the\nSteel City?\nMcCutchen remains a free agent after concluding the third season of his second stint in Pittsburgh.\nDuring the ever-popular “Ask Pirates Management” segment of PiratesFest on Saturday, General\nManager Ben Cherington was noncommittal on whether the Pirates will re-sign the former face of the\nfranchise.\n“Andrew has meant a ton to the team,” Cherington said, per Alex Stumpf of MLB.com. “He’s had an\nincredible run, in two different times with the Pirates. Certainly, his legacy is secure, and our desire —\neverybody at the Pirates would desire — to have him maintain a really good relationship with Andrew\nwell into the future.”\nCherington may be referring to a connection with Pirates alumni and returning to team events in the\nfuture.\nThe more Cherington spoke on the topic, the more it sounded like the Pirates are moving on.\n“Then we come back to our team. What is the job? The job is to build a team that gives us the best\nchance to be winning games when you’re in the ballpark in June and July, and that’s where I see the\npassion come out,” Cherington said.\nFollowing a season with PR nightmares, spotty attendance, and frequent “Sell The Team” chants, the\nPirates were the most active they’ve ever been in the Cherington era in adding to the roster.\nPittsburgh signed first baseman/DH Ryan O’Hearn to the first multi-year deal since Ivan Nova, traded\nfor 31 home-run hitting second baseman Brandon Lowe, and acquired outfielders Jake Mangum and\nJhostynxon Garcia.\nCherington said their approach has been based on winning more games this year than previous\nseasons and “that’s going to continue to guide our decisions.”\nThe Pirates, at least yet, haven’t deemed that McCutchen best puts them in position for this to come to\nfruition. This could be because they are chasing a bigger bat to acquire, or don’t want McCutchen back\nand haven’t wanted to tell him.\nCherington hasn’t been clear, but concluded: “So much respect for Andrew. That relationship is really\nimportant to us, and we’ll continue to communicate with him, directly, as the team comes together. We\nhave more work to do.”\nMcCutchen was not in attendance at the annual fan fest held at the David L. Lawrence Convention\nCenter.\nCherington didn’t close the door on a reunion with McCutchen, but the more time that passes makes it\nmore and more unlikely as we approach spring training.\nFrustrated by the process, McCutchen took to Twitter to express his feelings about being absent from\nPiratesFest.\nHe pointed to how the St. Louis Cardinals had a farewell season with Adam Wainwright, Albert Pujols,\nYadier Molina, the Dodgers with Clayton Kershaw, and the Tigers with Miguel Cabrera as examples of\nfranchise icons who had one final run and were either known, or strongly implied, that it was their final\nyear.\n“I wonder, did the Cards do this Wainwright/Pujols/Yadi? Dodgers to Kershaw? Tigers to Miggy? The\nlist goes on and on,” McCutchen said. “If this is my last year, it would have been nice to meet the fans\none last time as a player. Talk to them about my appreciation for them over the years. Shake that little\nkid’s hand or hug the fan that’s been a fan since Clemente.”\nIn 135 games, McCutchen hit .239 with 13 home runs and 57 RBIs for the Pirates in 2025. A 17-year\nMLB vet who has spent 12 in the black and gold, McCutchen is a five-time All-Star and four-time Silver\nSlugger winner.\nMcCutchen thinks the fan base deserves transparency. He believes it’s “bigger than baseball” with the\nrelationships McCutchen has built with loyal Pittsburgh sports fans.\n“You see, this is bigger than baseball!” McCutchen said. “Bigger than looking at a 40-man roster and\ncherry picking numbers that fit your agenda or prove why your opinion matters. The fans deserved at\nthe very least to get that opportunity.”\nMcCutchen ranked second on the team in hits (114) and third in home runs and RBIs. He still lives in\nPittsburgh with his wife, Maria, who welcomed the couple’s fifth child this month.\n“(I don’t know) what the future holds for me at the present moment, but what I do know is (that) though I\nam 39, on the backend of my career, I still work everyday to be better than I was the year before,”\nMcCutchen said. “If there wasn’t a burning desire to continue this journey, I would be home surrounded\nby my family, in which no one would judge or be surprised.”\nWhile the Pirates seemingly remain unsure if McCutchen has a role on the team in 2026, McCutchen\nisn’t ready to hang up the bats and cleats just yet.\n“But not yet,” McCutchen said. “There’s more work to do, and I’m not done, no matter what label you try\nto stamp on. Rip the jersey off of me. You don’t get to write my future, God does.”\nThere may be a role for McCutchen, but much more minimal than as the starting DH over the past three\nyears. O’Hearn will likely DH, but McCutchen could be a valuable asset to start against lefties.\nIn 131 at-bats last season against left-handers, McCutchen hit .267 with a .389 slugging percentage\nand .742 OPS.\nMcCutchen’s leadership, passion for the city, and, more importantly, his still decent bat speed could\nmake him a valuable asset as a pinch hitter late in games.\nHis eye for the strike zone may be an asset with the new ABS challenge system going into place.\nThe Pirates vastly improved their roster this offseason. The downside for many fans is that it likely\ncame at McCutchen’s expense."}

The characters were all petty and mean and greedy, revealing that the warm,\nglorious Christmases of the past weren't as sweet or easy as nostalgia night have one believe. Weirdly,\n\"A Christmas Story\" turned into the opposite of its thesis, shown on TV every Christmas season,\nsometimes over and over again in a day-long marathon.\nBillingsley was able to turn his work in \"A Christmas Story\" into something of a career, turning up in\noccasional movies and TV for at least another decade. In 1985, he starred in an enchanted vehicle\nfantasy film called \"The Dirt Bike Kid\" and turned up in episodes of \"Highway to Heaven\" and \"Punky\nBrewster.\" In 1984, he starred in a TV movie called \"The Hoboken Chicken Emergency,\" based on a\nnovel by Daniel Pinkwater, the author behind \"Lizard Music,\" Benny Safdie's next collaboration with\nDwayne Johnson. By 1994, though, when Billingsley was in his early 20s, starring in the sci-fi/horror\nfilm \"Arcade,\" he began to drift away from acting. Instead, as /Film once covered before, Peter\nBillingsley began to work as a producer.\nIn 2001, Billingsley served as a co-producer on an indie film called \"Made,\" starring, written by, and\ndirected by Jon Favreau. Billingsley would collaborate with Favreau multiple times, for which Favreau\nwould cast him in small roles in his films. In 2008, Billingsley even had a cameo in Favreau's superhero\nfilm \"Iron Man.\" This means he is officially part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."}

Her post on Reddit’s r/careerguidance community revealed the anxiety, self-doubt,\nand exhaustion she says now define both her professional and personal life, as shared by user\n'Natural-Hour-6739'.In her post, the woman explained that she does not want to get married but feels\nconstant pressure about whether she will ever be able to “settle” in life. She said she earns very little,\nhas no savings, and feels she has “failed somewhere along the way.”Although she works in tech, most\nof her experience is with older technologies, and a career gap has made it difficult to get shortlisted by\nmultinational companies, as per the Reddit post. She shared that repeated rejections and silence from\nrecruiters have deeply affected her confidence.Over time, these professional setbacks have taken a toll\non her mental health. She described struggling with depression, low motivation, constant self-doubt,\nand mental exhaustion.She said, \"I genuinely want to improve my situation, upskill, and build a stable\nand well-paying career, but I feel stuck and unsure about the right direction, what skills to focus on, how\nto overcome the career gap, and whether it’s too late to turn things around.

But he struck a more cautionary note. “Other AI applications can produce\ninaccurate results, can produce results that are not grounded in reality. That’s a risk with these systems\nas well.”\nPrivate developers trained their AI on a corpus of data that was largely publicly funded. While that\nbolsters the models’ credibility with scientists, it also raises troubling questions.\nFor one, private developers are, by definition, concerned with profit — eventually, if not immediately.\nThere is no guarantee they will not begin charging for access to their models.\n“Within a university context, we have no profit motivation at all,” Diffenbaugh said. “We’re trying to\nunderstand how the world works. And we’re doing that within our time scale, a much longer time scale\n(than private developers). And I think the benefit that we can bring in our work is that we’re doing that\nwork in the context of this rigorous, patient scientific evaluation.”\nThe primary question for Swain is whether optimism about end-to-end AI models could be used by\nTrump administration officials to justify ceding data collection and weather modeling entirely to the\nprivate sector, even as global warming dramatically alters the climate system, particularly in California,\nwith its complex interplay of atmospheric rivers, marine layers, Sierra snowpack, wind patterns and\nwildfire risk.\n“Not only are we not there yet, not only do I think we won’t be there anytime soon, I’m not sure that we\nwill ever get to that point,” Swain said. “It’s almost a category error to assume that the success of\nAI-based predictive modeling means that it’s just going to completely replace that whole pipeline. That’s\njust fundamentally divorced from the reality of the world we live in today, and very likely to be divorced\nfrom the reality of the world that we’re going to be living in for the foreseeable future.”"}

Colorado\nlawmakers unveil bills targeting costs.\n\nhttps://www.denverpost.com/2026/01/26/democrats-dynamic-pricing-stadium-concessions-legislature/\n\n\"Everyone has experienced the $20 beer at a Nuggets game, the $10 water at the airport or the $80\nTylenol at the emergency room. ... It's exploitation,\" Rep. Yara Zokaie said.\n\nColorado Democrats unveiled a trio of proposals Monday aimed at wrenching down rising prices that\nthey blamed on corporate greed — and at forestalling newer attempts at varying pricing for different\ncustomers.\nThe proposals include a measure that would require price transparency for what might be considered\n“captive consumers,” including at sporting events or airports. Another would prohibit wholesalers from\ngiving preferential pricing to large groups. And a third would ban companies from using consumers’\npersonal data to set prices or wages.\n“Affordability isn’t this abstract concept. Everyone has experienced the $20 beer at a Nuggets game,\nthe $10 water at the airport or the $80 Tylenol at the emergency room,” state Rep. Yara Zokaie, a Fort\nCollins Democrat, said during a news conference at the state Capitol. “When people are forced to pay\nmore, simply because they’re trapped, that isn’t the free market. It’s exploitation.”\nOnly the proposal to require more price transparency has been formally introduced, as House Bill 1012.\nSupporters expect the other measures to be introduced in the coming weeks.\nDemocrats framed the proposals as necessary to preserve the free market against large monopolies\nthat have undue power to set prices — including by harvesting user data — and to force out\ncompetition.\nThe proposal is already facing stiff opposition from business groups. Three dozen lobbyists, including\nthose representing the Colorado Hospital Association, the Colorado Bankers Association and various\nchambers of commerce, have registered outright opposition. Uber and DoorDash, whose delivery\nservices would also be affected by the bill, have registered amend positions, signalling they will seek\nchanges.\n“The Colorado Chamber opposes the bill due to feedback from our members that it’s overreaching,\ncreating new operational and legal costs for businesses across multiple industries statewide, with little\nbenefit to consumers,” said Meghan Dollar, the senior vice president of governmental affairs for the\nColorado Chamber of Commerce.”\nGov. Jared Polis has underscored the need for affordability but also regularly voices business-oriented\nconcerns, making him a wild card. Spokeswoman Shelby Wieman said Monday that he “is generally\nskeptical of these types of policies because they are not consistent with the laws of economics,” and he\nwill monitor its progress.\nThe price transparency bill builds off a 2025 law passed by legislators against so-called junk fees\ncharged by landlords. This iteration would prohibit businesses from charging “unreasonably excessive\nprices to a captive consumer.” Think sports fans whose only food options at a game are at stands all\noperated by the same big concessionaire.\nThe bill would also require businesses that sell delivery goods, such as grocery delivery providers or\nDoorDash, to list a comparison of the delivery price versus the regular price if the goods were to be\nbought in-person at the store.\n“Our economy is failing working people because corporations have been allowed to extract, overcharge\nand consolidate power with no real accountability,” Zokaie said. “They have found new and unique\nways to squeeze every last cent from working people. Today, we are drawing a hard line against that\nsystem.”\nThe anti-price gouging measure, as written, would declare it an unfair or deceptive trade practice if a\nbusiness charges a higher price than the average for a similar good or service within the same county.\nSo that $20 beer, if it costs half that at a bar down the street, might run afoul of the proposed law unless\nthe seller can show the price is not unreasonably excessive.\nThe bill would task the state’s attorney general with establishing the guidelines to determine\nunreasonably excessive prices for captive consumers, such as at airports, hospitals, sporting events,\nlarge festivals or in correctional facilities.\nLawmakers say the onus for preventing pricing abuses is on the state since the Trump administration\nhas largely retreated from business regulations and has sought to dismantle the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau, or CFPB.\nThe federal agency was tasked with creating and enforcing rules to protect consumers from abusive\npractices across a range of financial institutions. Some Republicans have assailed the agency as\noverregulating industry. President Donald Trump said early in his second term that the bureau was “set\nup to destroy people.”\nSen. Mike Weissman, an Aurora Democrat, said the bills would rely on the Colorado Attorney General’s\nOffice for enforcement, using powers from the state Consumer Protection Act.\n“Historically, you’ve had maybe the prospect of state and federal enforcement,” Weissman said. “But as\nwe live now, there isn’t a functional CFPB anymore. It’s been put through the wood chipper. It’s mulch\nnow. So state enforcement through the Colorado attorney general will be important.”\nThe bill that would restrict the use of consumer data to set prices and wages also steps into regulations\non algorithmic decision-making, which is part of the thrust of lawmakers’ long-debated, and still in flux,\nregulations on artificial intelligence.\nWeissman said this bill was designed to stand alone.\n“We are playing against a supercomputer when we walk into a grocery store,” said Rep. Jennifer\nBacon, a Denver Democrat. “We are playing against a supercomputer when we go to buy clothes.”\nDemocrats have nearly 2-to-1 majorities in both chambers of the legislature, meaning the bills could\neasily pass on partisan lines.\nRepublicans, however, have vowed to fight.\nRep. Chris Richardson, an Elbert County Republican, warned of overregulation having the effect of\ndriving up costs. He focused on the price transparency measure, since it was the only one introduced\nso far.\nDemocrats specifically cited the cost of goods in airports, hospitals and stadiums. But stadiums have\ndifferent standards and costs than many other businesses, Richardson said, making it unfair to set\ncertain cost requirements.\n“How do you compare a stadium hot dog inside a venue to a push-cart hot dog vendor, who’s within the\nsame county but out on the street?” Richardson said. “The overhead for the small guy is very low.”\nHe further worried that businesses would struggle to abide by new, potentially vague rules, and the\nlegislation could have the inverse effect of what supporters intend by burying businesses in more\nregulation.\nStay up-to-date with Colorado Politics by signing up for our weekly newsletter, The Spot."}

They are also submitted to the AI Review\nCommittee for independent oversight.\nThe office said that the framework would increase safety by identifying factors that could elevate the\nneed for tighter controls, including “bias testing, accessibility checks and human-rights screening,\nmeaning appropriate safeguards can be in place before deployment”.\niTnews understands that existing AI deployments won't be required to be re-assessed under the new\nframework provided their scope, risk and features haven't changed greatly since their prior evaluation."}

The Wall Street Journal reports that in the official internal briefing he was accused of\nleaking nuclear weapons secrets to the US. As I wrote Saturday…\n\nThere will be no newsletter Tuesday as I am attending a conference. I will be back in your inboxes\nWednesday.\nWe still have no more concrete information than we had Saturday about the Zhang Youxia and Liu\nZhenli case. The Wall Street Journal reports that in the official internal briefing he was accused of\nleaking nuclear weapons secrets to the US. As I wrote Saturday, the official, internal story is not always\nthe truth about what happened, so just because they may be telling other officials he leaked nuclear\nsecrets does not mean he actually did, and as much as I would like to believe the US government is\nthat good at getting intelligence, I am skeptical Zhang was leaking to the US. But it might make for a\nuseful charge internally, as it shows him to be an even greater villain than if he were simply corrupt, as\nhe was working for the main enemy.\nThere are lots of other rumors going around. I advise skepticism.\nThe best article on Zhang I have seen so far is by Drew Thompson, who writes about his interactions\nwith Zhang in 2012, when he was Director for China, Taiwan and Mongolia in the Office of the\nSecretary of Defense. In The demise of Zhang Youxia hits different he writes:\nGeneral Zhang Youxia spent a week in the United States in May 2012 as part of a delegation led by\nDefense Minister General Liang Guanglie, hosted by then Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta. Zhang\nwas Shenyang Military Region Commander at the time, one of over ten general officers on the\ndelegation with Defense Minister Liang. In 2012, I was the Director for China, Taiwan and Mongolia in\nthe Office of the Secretary of Defense, responsible for planning and organizing the delegation’s visit to\nthe United States. I accompanied them on the trip including meetings in the Pentagon and tours of\nmilitary bases on the East and West coasts.\nI got to know Zhang Youxia on that trip, and I liked him...\nMy hope – for the sake of stable US-China military-to-military relations and cross-Strait stability - was\nthat Zhang Youxia would stay at the top of the CMC and remain Xi Jinping’s closest military advisor. I\nthink he was the one active duty PLA officer who could give Xi the best, most objective advice about\nPLA military capabilities including the PLA’s shortcomings, and crucially the human cost of military\nconflict. I think he could assess US and Taiwan military capabilities objectively and explain to Xi Jinping\nwhat the military risks and costs of an operation to take Taiwan would be. A sycophant with no combat\nexperience has to tell Xi what Xi wants to hear. Zhang’s intellect, experience and his relationship with Xi\nmade honesty and objectivity possible, and that makes him an exception among PLA generals.\nFor a US deterrence strategy to be effective we need Xi Jinping to be surrounded by competent\ngenerals who will give him objective advice. The sole remaining general on the CMC is Zhang\nShengmin, a career political commissar. Leaving aside the governance and operational risks of Xi\nbeing advised by and trying to command a million-man army through a one-man committee, I worry\nabout the consequences of someone other than Zhang Youxia providing Xi Jinping with military advice.\nWithout Zhang Youxia on the CMC, the risk of miscalculation goes up...\nThompson also drops a bit of a bomb at the end, telling us that according to Minnie Chan, then a\nreporter for South China Morning Post who has disappeared since late 2023, both Zhang Youxia and\nZhang Shengmin were being investigated:\nIn October 2023, South China Morning Post reporter Minnie Chan was visiting Beijing for the\nXiangshan Forum when she disappeared. She was researching rumors that Zhang Youxia and Zhang\nShengmin were being investigated at the time...\nWe would sometimes speak on the phone, and sometimes text. Soon after she disappeared, all but one\nof her texts to me were deleted. I don’t know if she deleted them or if it was whoever is holding her and\ntook control of her phone.\nA month before her disappearance we were discussing whether or not Zhang Youxia and Zhang\nShengmin were being investigated. She was certain. In September 2023 when I asked, “Do you think\nZhang Youxia and Zhang Shengmin are in trouble and being investigated?” She responded succinctly,\n“Yes”.\nThat one word text is the only one in the string that was not deleted.\nIf Chan was right, that makes the case even more interesting."}

They demand something more\nfundamental: Will my job last? Will my family be secure? Will my skills remain relevant tomorrow?\nThese questions speak not just of employment, but of confidence in the future.\nIndia’s journey towards Viksit Bharat is not only about creating jobs — it is about creating confidence\namong workers. Confidence that effort will be rewarded. Confidence that mobility will not mean loss of\nsecurity. Confidence that change will bring opportunity, not vulnerability.\nFor a long time, labour policy in India was largely about welfare delivery and dispute resolution. While\nthese remain important, they are no longer sufficient for a fast-changing economy. Today, the role of\nthe Labour Ministry is evolving — from being a regulator of the past to becoming an enabler of the\nfuture workforce.\nNeed for dignity\nYears of engagement with people at the grassroots has deeply shaped this perspective. I have spoken\nto young people entering the job market for the first time, uncertain whether degrees will translate into\nlivelihoods. I have met migrant workers who want to move for opportunity without losing access to\nsocial protection. I have interacted with platform workers who seek fairness and recognition in new\nforms of employment. Their aspirations point to a simple truth: workers do not want dependency; they\nwant predictability and dignity.\nThis is where reform becomes meaningful. Our efforts are focused on building systems that travel with\nthe worker— across jobs, locations, and life stages. Social security must no longer be static or\nfragmented; it must be portable, digital, and inclusive. Employment frameworks must encourage\nformalisation without discouraging enterprise. Most importantly, policy must keep pace with how work\nitself is changing.\nThe world of work is being reshaped by technology, global supply chains, and evolving\nemployer-employee relationships. Gig work, remote employment, automation, and international labour\nmobility are no longer future concepts — they are today’s reality. The challenge before us is to ensure\nthat flexibility does not come at the cost of fairness, and innovation does not weaken protection.\nCompassionate reforms\nThe Labour Ministry’s approach is guided by a clear principle: reform with compassion, growth with\ninclusion. Labour reforms are being pursued not as isolated legal exercises, but as instruments to\nexpand coverage, reduce uncertainty, and create an ecosystem where enterprises grow and workers\nfeel secure. Dialogue and trust are central to this journey. Sustainable reform cannot be achieved\nthrough directives alone. It requires continuous engagement with workers’ organisations, employers,\nand state governments. Consensus may take time, but it ensures durability — and durability is essential\nfor long-term confidence.\nUltimately, the success of India’s growth story will be measured not only by economic indicators, but by\nthe confidence with which workers plan their future.\nA confident workforce is more productive, more innovative, and more resilient. It is also the strongest\nfoundation of social harmony.\nThe Ministry of Labour & Employment is actively working to translate this vision into action —\nstrengthening institutions, modernising systems, and aligning policy with the realities of a 21st-century\nworkforce. The goal is clear: to ensure that every worker feels secure enough to aspire, skilled enough\nto compete, and confident enough to move forward.\nThe writer is Union Minister of State for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, and Labour and\nEmployment\nPublished on January 27, 2026"}

Phase 1 of implementation should focus on\nenterprise-wide data mapping, lawful purpose articulation and third-party alignment, while later phases\nshould test the maturity of embedded privacy controls, automated rights management and audit-ready\ninfrastructure, Loganey said.One of the most significant changes under the DPDP Act is the\nintroduction of a dual-reporting regime for data breaches Financial institutions will need to align privacy\nbreach notifications with existing cyber incident reporting frameworks of the banking and insurance\nregulators and the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In).“Timely, coordinated\ndisclosures to both regulators and affected data principals will be critical,” Loganey said.The Act also\nraises complex questions around data erasure rights versus statutory retention obligations under\nReserve Bank of India rules and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Experts recommend\nconditional erasure models that clearly separate data subject to mandatory retention from discretionary\ndata, supported by transparent retention schedules and audit trails.From a technology and governance\nperspective, the DPDP Rules are forcing a mindset shift across the BFSI (banking, financial services\nand insurance) sector.Amit Das, founder and chief executive of Think360.ai, said the law has moved\nprivacy from the periphery to the core of data architecture. “Banks are breaking large data lakes into\npurpose-bound zones; fintechs are redesigning onboarding to capture granular, revocable consent; and\nNBFCs are mapping complex third-party data flows,” he said. “Regulators will increasingly demand\nproof, access logs, consent trails and deletion evidence, not just policies.”The biggest leadership\nchallenge is accepting that privacy can no longer sit solely with legal or compliance teams, Das said.\n“Privacy by design means every data field, API and model must assume scrutiny. If compliance\ndepends on spreadsheets and emails, the design is already broken,” he said.Looking ahead, AI is\nexpected to play a central role in scaling DPDP compliance, from continuous consent monitoring and\nautomated rights handling to rapid breach impact assessments. While the near term may feel\ncompliance-heavy, industry leaders believe the long-term payoff is trust.“Implemented well, DPDP can\nbecome a powerful trust enabler,” Das said. “Transparency and accountable data use will translate into\nhigher digital engagement, better retention and stronger brand value.”As enforcement draws closer, the\nmessage across India’s financial sector is that privacy is no longer just a regulatory obligation, but a\ncompetitive differentiator shaping the future of digital finance."}

She currently receives treatment two Mondays in a\nrow before skipping the next Monday.\n\"For me, it's keeping me alive, giving me more time with family. When that's canceled, it's\nanxiety-riddling. My family, my children, were all affected,\" Basham said.\nBasham believes she wasn't alone among cancer patients facing treatment cancellations.\n\"Talking to my doctor, and I know other patients have been canceled. I’ve spoken to other staff who are\nfriends of mine. Other patients have been canceled. It's a significant amount of people,\" Basham said.\nFollowing her treatment cancellation, Basham made a plea to her oncologist during a virtual\nappointment.\n\"I advocated and shared how much stress this was putting on me and family and blatantly asked her,\n‘So how much is my cancer going to grow?’” Basham said.\nHer doctor appealed to hospital officials, and on Friday, Basham received a call saying her treatment\nwas back on.\n\"Elated, relieved. My children were happy to hear Mom would be back on her treatment,\" Basham said.\nBasham received her treatment on Monday afternoon at the Zion Medical Center. She's scheduled to\nreceive treatment next Monday as well, but worries about future sessions if the strike continues.\n“If the strike continues, it could be impacted then,\" Basham said.\nBasham is calling on Kaiser Permanente to increase temporary staffing and prioritize patients with the\ngreatest needs.\n\"This is vital care, so it's wrong for it to be delayed,\" Basham said.\nKaiser Permanente issued a statement saying:\nWe are absolutely committed to ensuring our patients receive safe, timely, high-quality care, even\nduring this unnecessary strike. The health and safety of our members is our top priority, and we have\nput extensive plans in place to minimize disruption to care. As part of this work, all oncology patients\nwere carefully evaluated by clinical experts to ensure that any scheduling adjustments were safe,\naligned with standards of care, medically appropriate and that urgent needs were prioritized without\ndelay. Our hospitals and medical offices remain open, and our teams, including physicians,\nexperienced managers, and licensed supplemental staff, are working together to maintain access to\nessential services.

The yen held its gains.The Kospi Index, one of the world’s\nbest-performing benchmarks this year, fell 0.9%, while the South Korean won weakened after four days\nof gains. Japanese shares fell for a second day, weighed down by a stronger yen.The yen traded near\naround 154 per dollar after gaining on the greenback over the past two sessions amid speculation the\nUS may coordinate intervention with Japan. A gauge of the dollar was steady Tuesday, hovering\naround levels last seen in 2022. Gold and silver also traded near their record highs on Tuesday.While\nmuch of the market’s focus has been on currencies and the risk of yen intervention, tariff concerns have\nalso resurfaced after Trump warned of 100% levies on Canada. The added uncertainty comes in a\npivotal week for investors, with megacap technology earnings set to test whether the\nartificial-intelligence driven rally can be sustained.“Tech has become more of a show-me story,” said\nDarrell Cronk, chief investment officer for wealth and investment management at Wells Fargo, which\nmanages $2.3 trillion. “If Big Tech can continue to deliver, I think capital will start flowing in tech’s\ndirection again.”In the US, companies accounting for roughly a third of the S&P; 500’s market\ncapitalization report this week.The US president has ratcheted up trade tensions with several allies in\nrecent weeks, threatening to raise duties on Canadian products to 100% if Ottawa signed a trade deal\nwith China. Trump attributed a 25% tariff hike on South Korean goods to the country’s legislature failing\nto codify a trade agreement reached with the US last year.Trump had earlier threatened to slap new\ncharges on European countries’ goods over his quest to seize control of Greenland. He then backed\noff.Meanwhile, the yen’s gains remained in focus after comments from Japanese officials fueled\nspeculation that the government may intervene in the market to prevent the currency from resuming its\nslide. To some, however, the recent rally has partly neutralized the likelihood of intervention.“The\ndramatic recovery in the yen suggests that actual intervention is not needed,” said Marc Chandler at\nBannockburn Capital Markets.Elsewhere, US power grids are under mounting pressure following a\nwinter storm that unleashed deep cold and heavy snow and ice from Texas to Maine. That’s knocked\nan estimated 12% of US natural gas production off-line and forecasts for frigid weather caused prices to\nsoar.US natural gas prices jumped around 30%.Treasuries remained in a narrow range on Monday\nwith the Federal Reserve expected to pause its rate cuts when it announces its policy on\nWednesday.Fed officials are expected to hold rates steady following three straight cuts at the end of\n2025, as a steadier jobs market restores a degree of consensus at the central bank after months of\ngrowing division. Chair Jerome Powell is likely to telegraph his view that policy is well-positioned for\nnow, but refrain from signaling much about where rates are headed.Expectations about Fed policy\nhave been shifting in response to changes in the consensus view on whom Trump will nominate to\nsucceed Powell, whose term expires in May.“Even though the Fed isn’t expected to cut interest rates,\nPowell’s press conference may be as much about Fed independence as it is policy,” said Chris Larkin\nat E*Trade from Morgan Stanley."}

According to Forbes,\nbleisure travel grew 25% in 2024, and TravelPerk projects growth of 500%+ by 2033.\nSo what’s actually changing the game this year? And what should hoteliers be paying attention to?\nBleisure travelers no longer want to choose between productivity and pleasure — they expect both,\nseamlessly built into the stay. That’s why work-life integration by design is becoming essential.\nMulti-functional spaces like coworking floors, integrated hotel-office environments, and hybrid\nproperties are on the rise. Some brands are even launching dedicated work-stay concepts, from\nextended-stay layouts to beachside work pods designed for deep focus by day and full disconnect by\nnight.\nFlexibility is also redefining how stays are booked and experienced. Half-day room rates, extended\nstays, and hybrid meeting packages are blurring the traditional boundaries between business and\nleisure. What used to be a rigid itinerary is now fluid, giving travelers more control over how and where\nthey work.\nAnd finally, the guest experience itself is becoming more intentional. Bleisure travelers are drawn to\nhotels that weave in local culture through authentic design, regional food, and wellness programming.\nPersonalized touches like welcome gifts, loyalty incentives, and lifestyle-driven services help guests\nfeel equally supported in getting things done and truly recharging.\nBleisure isn’t about escaping work.\nIt’s about designing travel that actually fits real life.\nSo, are you team “stay an extra Sunday” or “work from the pool”?\nABOUT GCSTIMES\nSince 2011, GCSTlMES has pioneered sustainable development, evolving from smart card R&D; to\nsustainable material innovation.

The device is now available in the U.S. for $259.99 USD\nwithout any monthly subscription fees.\nThe camera recently earned 19 ‘Best of IFA 2025’ awards for its dual-lens system. One lens provides a\nwide-angle 4K view of your yard, while the second lens uses a 6x hybrid zoom to track and follow\npeople or vehicles. Both views appear on a single screen in the Reolink app, so you can see the big\npicture and fine details at the same time. Essentially, there are no blind spots, so watch out bad guys\n(and teenagers trying to sneak out).\nFor night security, the TrackFlex features powerful 3,000-lumen dimmable LEDs. You can choose\nbetween cool or warm light to improve colour footage in the dark. If an intruder is detected, the camera\ncan trigger a loud 110-decibel siren.\nThe device also uses local AI to help you find specific footage quickly. Instead of scrolling through\nhours of video, you can search for descriptions like “man in a blue shirt” or “package delivery.” Because\nthis AI processing happens on the camera itself, your video stays private and off the cloud.\nTo ensure nothing is missed, the camera includes three sensors that detect motion in a 270-degree\nzone. Even if something happens out of the camera’s current line of sight, the sensors will pick up the\nmovement and tell the camera to turn and record it.\nIn terms of smart home platform support, the TrackFlex supports Google Home and Amazon’s Alexa,\nbut Apple HomeKit is not supported. There is a workaround, but it requires using the Reolink plugin for\nHomebridge, which is a popular way to expose the camera’s video feed to HomeKit.\nWe’ll update this story on Canadian pricing and availability shortly, stay tuned for updates."}

But emerging evidence\nsuggests their real-world productivity remains far below expectations.\nRecent industry research cited by the Financial Times shows that humanoid robots are operating at\nless than half the efficiency of human workers in early deployments, based on metrics such as task\ncompletion speed, reliability and sustained output. While robots can perform individual actions\ncompetently, they struggle to match humans when tasks require fluid sequences, adaptation or\nuninterrupted execution in dynamic environments.\nThis productivity shortfall is beginning to reshape expectations. Companies experimenting with\nhumanoid robots are increasingly treating them as long-term bets rather than short-term efficiency\ntools. Even well-funded pilots often require extensive human supervision, frequent resets and\nenvironmental adjustments that dilute the promised gains. Instead of accelerating output, many\ndeployments introduce new layers of complexity that offset automation benefits.\nWhy Physical Intelligence Remains the Limiting Factor\nThe primary bottleneck is not cognitive intelligence but physical execution. While advances in large\nlanguage models have improved robots’ ability to interpret instructions and plan actions, translating\nthose plans into reliable movement remains difficult. Real-world environments are noisy, irregular and\nfull of edge cases that machines handle poorly.\nVision systems are sensitive to lighting changes, reflections and partial occlusion. Grasping systems\nfail when objects vary slightly in shape or weight. Locomotion consumes significant energy and\ncompute, limiting how long robots can operate at productive levels without recharging or recalibration.\nEach failure introduces downtime, eroding throughput and consistency.\nAcademic research reinforces this pattern. A study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nexamining AI’s impact on productivity found that AI systems tend to deliver weaker gains in settings that\nrequire contextual judgment, adaptation and real-time physical interaction. Productivity improvements\nwere strongest where tasks were structured, predictable and tightly scoped, conditions that humanoid\nrobots rarely encounter outside lab environments.\nFuturism pointed to mounting evidence that AI systems, including embodied AI, often fail to boost\nproductivity at scale because performance degrades outside ideal conditions. Small inefficiencies\ncompound over time, turning marginal slowdowns into material operational drag.\nThe challenge is compounded by training constraints. Teaching robots to handle edge cases requires\nlarge volumes of real-world data, which is expensive and slow to collect. Simulation helps but does not\nfully capture physical unpredictability. As a result, improvements arrive incrementally rather than\nthrough rapid step changes, limiting short-term productivity impact.\nWhere Robots Are Delivering Measurable Productivity Gains\nDespite these limitations, robots are delivering tangible productivity improvements in narrowly defined\nuse cases. The strongest gains appear in repetitive, high-volume tasks where environments can be\noptimized for machines rather than humans.\nWarehousing and logistics stand out as early successes. Robots used for picking, sorting and\ntransporting standardized packages have improved throughput and reduced error rates by operating\ncontinuously and consistently. These systems benefit from structured layouts, known object dimensions\nand fixed workflows that minimize variability. In such settings, productivity gains come from endurance\nand precision rather than adaptability.\nBut Gartner has warned that humanoid robots are unlikely to deliver broad productivity gains across\nglobal supply chains in the near term, arguing that most value today comes from task-specific\nautomation layered into existing operations rather than wholesale replacement of human workflows,\naccording to Supply Chain Digital.\nThe Wall Street Journal has similarly argued that productivity growth depends less on humanoid form\nfactors and more on how well automation aligns with economic reality. Technologies that complement\nhuman labor in constrained domains tend to scale faster than those attempting full general-purpose\nsubstitution."}

Ties have deteriorated since Japanese leader Sanae Takaichi angered\nChina in November by commenting on how Tokyo might respond to a Chinese attack on Taiwan.\nU.S. President Donald Trump later that month asked Takaichi, a staunch nationalist who became prime\nminister in October, not to further inflame the tensions. Reuters couldn’t determine whether the pleas to\nthe fishermen were ordered by Takaichi or linked to the appeal from the United States, Japan’s security\nbacker.\nTakaichi’s office and Japan’s foreign ministry declined to address questions about the requests to\nfishermen. The foreign ministry said in a statement that the islands were an inherent part of Japan’s\nterritory and that it had repeatedly lodged diplomatic protests over Chinese incursions.\nThe warnings issued to fishermen illustrate a catch-22 for Tokyo: Fishing underlines Japan’s control of\nthe islands but risks triggering a more serious confrontation with Chinese coast guard vessels that\ncould escalate rapidly, according to more than a dozen people interviewed by Reuters, including\nfishermen, Japanese officials and security analysts. Yet a pullback may lead China to more assertively\npress its claims, some of these people said.\nChina’s foreign ministry told Reuters some right-wing Japanese had repeatedly entered the waters of\nthe islands “in the name of ‘fishing’ to provoke and cause trouble”, adding that maritime issues should\nbe addressed through dialogue and consultation.\nA Trump administration official declined to address questions about the president’s November call with\nTakaichi but said the U.S. opposed unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the East China Sea.\nSMALL INCIDENTS CAN ‘LEAD TO WAR’\nAs tensions with China flared in November, the pleas to fishermen began.\nHiroaki Hayashi, a businessman who chairs a nationalist group that helps fund Nakama’s fishing trips,\ntold Reuters he received a request from a Japanese coast guard official to stop Nakama from going on\na planned voyage at the end of that month. Nakama reluctantly opted to steer clear, Hayashi said.\nAnother fisherman, Kazushi Kinjo, 53, said he had been planning to fish around the islands during a\nweek-long voyage that started on November 26. But just before he set sail, and while at sea, he\nreceived calls from multiple officials urging him to avoid the Senkaku islands.\n“They’ve never said anything like that to me before,” he said, declining to identify the officials. Kinjo said\nhe briefly transited the waters around the islands on the way back to his home port but didn’t stop to\nfish.\nA few weeks later, Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama - previously an adviser to the Senkaku Islands\nDefence Association, the nationalist group that supports Nakama - hosted the fisherman in Tokyo on\nDecember 19.\nDuring their 20-minute meeting, she asked about his previous visits to the islands and remarked that\n“small incidents can grow bigger and lead to war”, Nakama said. He interpreted the message as a\nrequest to stay away, though she didn’t say so directly, he said.\n“What she was really saying was that she didn’t want me to go,” Nakama told Reuters as small waves\nrocked his boat in his home port of Ishigaki, where he serves as a local councillor.\nKatayama’s office declined to comment on the meeting. The Japan Coast Guard said it informs relevant\nparties about the security situation in waters surrounding the islands as necessary, but declined to\ndiscuss specifics.\nIshigaki Mayor Yoshitaka Nakayama said Japanese officials appeared concerned about the risk that\nfishermen could be detained or subjected to inspections by Chinese authorities during a period of\nheightened tensions with Beijing.\n“If someone should actually be detained it would escalate into a much bigger international issue, so I\nthink that is what the government wants to avoid,” he told Reuters at his office.\nChina in recent years has stepped up efforts to enforce its sweeping maritime claims, notably in\nrepeated confrontations with Philippine vessels in which Chinese coast guard ships used water\ncannons.\nThe last major maritime dispute between China and Japan erupted in 2010, after Japan’s coast guard\ndetained the captain of a Chinese fishing boat that collided with Japanese vessels near the\nSenkaku/Diaoyu islands. Relations soured further in 2012 when Japan nationalised several of the\nthen-privately owned islands.\nWashington has committed to defending the islands under its security treaty with Japan, meaning any\nclash there risks drawing in the United States.\n“It’s kind of the touch paper for further deterioration between Japan and China, because China is really\npushing its claims on the islands. It is phenomenally tense around there at the moment,” said Robert\nWard, Japan chair at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).\nChinese coast guard ships were spotted near the islands on a record 357 days last year, according to\nJapan’s coast guard. The islands lie more than 300 kilometres from mainland China, about 150\nkilometres from Japan’s nearest inhabited territory, and about 170 kilometres from Taiwan, which also\nclaims them.\nGOOD FISHING\nFishing has long been associated with the islands.\nAfter Japan first claimed them in the late 19th century, a skipjack tuna processing plant was established\non the main Uotsuri Island until it was abandoned in the 1930s.\nIn 1977, before Beijing began more assertively pressing its claims and scaring off fishermen, there\nwere at least 164 Japanese fishing trips to the islands, according to a Japanese\ngovernment-commissioned research report.\nLast year, there were only eight documented visits by Japanese fishing vessels, down from 18 in 2024,\naccording to the Japan Coast Guard.\nNakama and his nationalist backers say they are determined to reverse the decline in fishing around\nthe islands, arguing that such activity helps demonstrate Japan’s control.\nPaul Midford, a professor of international studies at Meiji Gakuin University in Yokohama, said while\nthat argument has merit, it can lead to escalation as both sides try to outdo each other to demonstrate\ncontrol.\nYet a complete lack of Japanese economic activity could invite China to flood the area with its own\nships, said IISS’s Ward. “The need for Japan to keep showing it has a pulse in the Senkaku Islands is\nreally important,” he said.\nKinjo said his motivation is money, not politics.\n“I earn my income there… a substantial income,” he said, describing the seas as a treasure trove of red\nsnapper, a local delicacy.\nWhile rough winter seas may help keep fishermen away for now, Kinjo and Nakama said they were\ndetermined to return soon, despite the risks.\n“I’ll go there for as long as I have this boat. I’ll keep on going,” Nakama said, as he sat on an ice box on\nthe deck of his ship.\n(Reporting by Mariko Katsumura in Ishigaki and Nobuhiro Kubo, Tim Kelly and John Geddie in Tokyo;\nadditional reporting by Laurie Chen in Beijing and Trevor Hunnicutt in Washington; editing by David\nCrawshaw.)"}

Real outfits,\nlayering tips, and NYC travel advice.\n\nOk friends. Remember when I did a post like this two years ago? I was lucky enough to get to go back\nto New York City this January to enjoy more museums, Broadway, Brooklyn, Printemps, the Lower East\nSide and, of course, the food.\nI’m a very fortunate lady who gets to travel to New York every once in a while with my bestie, Posy. She\nhas family there and lets her friends tagalong to enjoy the city with her while providing a little\ncompanionship during her family responsibilities there.\nWhat I Packed for a Winter Trip to New York City\nWhen I visit New York with Posy we tend to stick to Brooklyn and the Lower East Side a lot because\nher family lives on Staten Island. It’s a whole new experience visiting NYC this way and I have fallen in\nlove with both of those areas. SI, shoutout to you for the best pizza (Denino’s I’m looking at you),\nmultiple turkey sightings (IYKYK), more decorative columns per square capita than anywhere else and\nsome of the best authentic pasta I’ve ever eaten (though sadly Basilio Inn is closed in winter). And if\nyou haven’t watched King of Staten Island, it’s such a freaking good film, whether you’ve visited or not.\nOn this trip, we planned to do some museum time in the city, eat all the yummy food, shop in Brooklyn\nand go see Oh, Mary! on Broadway. Here’s the packing list I made out before I went to plan what to\ntake to accommodate bopping around the city, travel days and a slightly dressier option for our\nBroadway evening.\n01 | 02 | 03 | 04 (similar) | 05 | 06 | 07 | 08 | 09 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17\nSo…while this was a winter trip I will let you know we freaking lucked out on our temperatures,\nespecially for mid January. It was mostly highs in the upper 40’s and lows in the 30’s but above freezing\nthe entire time, until the day we flew out. And it wasn’t windy until the last day, either. I know. Lucky. I\nwound up making a couple of last-minute changes below but stuck to this packing collage I made pretty\nclosely.\nI only wore gloves one evening. But my giant scarf and layering were still important. I’d still dress\nsimilarly in colder weather but would have added some silk long underwear underneath.\nPictured above are shots from Printemps (the French department store located in the Financial\nDistrict…100% worth a visit gahhh), gratuitous subway moment, our film print from the photo booth\nplace located on the Lower East Side near Russ & Daughters (you must do both), a cool bathroom in\nRoyal Palms shuffleboard bar in Brooklyn, a blue cheese olive martini the size of my head at Tony Di\nNapoli, and my playbill for Jinx Monsoon starring in Oh, Mary! on Broadway (hilariously delightful).\nThe Outfits I Wore In New York City In Winter\nAnd here are the looks I put together for our various activities around the city. I was pretty happy with\nhow they functioned and how I felt in them…both important when you’re out and about for the day. I\nwound up also grabbing a tote at Russ + Daughters that held my scarf and purchases and that was\nnice to have. Highly recommend packing a Baggu shopping tote, too. Those are so light and easy to\nbring and perfect for souvenirs you might accumulate.\nOutfit 1| Oversized Blazer + Baggy Jeans for Exploring NYC\nBlazer Jacket (S) | Shirt (M) | Jeans (30) | Sneakers | Bag | Necklace\nThis outfit was great for a day on the Lower East Side. We started with brunch at Russ & Daughters\n(we go everytime…it’s a must) where we also took home chocolate babka for later. Andrea and I said\ngoodbye to Posy who had to take her dad to some appointments and we explored a few shops in the\narea before checking out another (we’d done one before) tour at the Tenement Museum. I highly\nrecommend adding in these 1 hour tours when you’re in the area. More details at the bottom of my\npost.\nWe then hopped the subway over to the Financial District to check out Printemps French department\nstore. And oh my. You MUST see it. This comfy look felt just put together enough to be in such a fancy\nplace and have a drink at one of the bars. I was glad it was the day I had this button down and blazer\non.\nAnd I must give a shoutout to the Clare V. Moyen Messenger bag for being with me on all my recent\ntrips to NYC (and honestly all my recent trips in general.) It is the comfiest, loveliest, most packable\ncrossbody and it’s easy and pretty and all the things, including the perfect size. My friend Andrea here\neven borrowed it on one of her trips to NY without me. The Quince version is nice at an\neasier-to-swallow price point, but the leather is not as soft and the lining isn’t as luxe.\nOutfit 2 | Casual Brooklyn Layers (Bomber, Cashmere & Black Jeans)\nJacket (M) | Similar Sweater | Tee (M) | Jeans (30) | Sneakers | Bag | Similar Hat\nThis more casual outfit was perfect for bopping around Brooklyn on one of our days. I layered a\ncashmere sweater and white tee underneath and was really comfortable all day. If I had wanted a bit\nheavier layer, the hoodie I brought would have been perfect. These jeans are currently my freaking\nfavorite, but I’d for sure put on some silk long underwear if it had been any colder because wide legs +\ncold are a leetle breezy lol.\nBut for sunny and in the 40’s they were perfect. And I felt cool with my baggy-on-baggy pieces. These\nadidas Gazelle Bolds I’ve raved about were amazing the entire time and I have hereditarily bad feet, so\nI was so happy with this choice.\nOutfit 3 | My Go-To NYC Museum + Broadway Outfit\nJacket (M) | Similar Dress (or this top for a similar look) | Similar Boots | Bag\nThis outfit was my museum-to-Broadway option I came up with and it wound up working great. We had\na slow morning in Staten Island and then headed to the MoMA for lunch and a quick jaunt through the\namazing collection. My friends were in a little bit of a hurry and I would have liked to have spent a bit\nmore time there, but we had places to go and Broadway plays to see.\nI’d give yourself a good three hours to peruse if you were perhaps an art major and have a deep\nconnection with some of the paintings there like I do lol. I’m not a read-every-plaque gal, but I do like to\nimmerse myself in some paintings for a minute. Gosh, what an amazing museum. I can’t believe it was\nmy first time there. Finally.\nI swapped out my boots for some pointed toe snakeskin boots I have and love for dinner and our play,\nbut I don’t know that I actually needed to. I felt a little more fancy, but honestly black boots would have\nbeen fine, especially since I had a dress and tights on.\n4 | Travel Day Outfit (With A Jacket Swap)\nBlazer Jacket (S) | Hoodie (M) | Similar Pants | Bag | Similar Boots | Suitcase\nI tried this on the day before leaving and had planned on this being my travel outfit (sorry, West Coast\nproblems…I have to arrive so freaking early to fly East that I never want an in-aiport photo…5 am is too\nearly for that y’all.) But I wound up actually wearing the bomber jacket and packing this blazer in my\nlarge suitcase. It was a good choice because the bomber became like a puffy blanket on the flight and\nthe blazer packed more easily.\nMy go-to travel hoodie from Comfrt is the softest thing in the land and has all the nice pockets for\nAirpods (sadly I left mine at home accidentally, doh, do not recommend) and all your other tech. My\nnew favorite thing is to wear black athleisure trouser-like pants on flights so I have a black pant for my\narrival but sneakily they are pull-on and way comfier than traditional trousers. Em swears by the pair I\nlinked here and I have some adidas pieces in the same luxe fabric that are incredibly good. (My actual\npants are older Zella and sadly sold out long ago.) A tech fabric reads dressier than fleece would here,\nso I do avoid wearing actual sweatpants. This style is much more versatile for other outfits I pull\ntogether on the trip.\nOutfit 5 | An Easy, Elevated Look for a Casual NYC Night\nBlazer Jacket (S) | Similar Sweater | Similar Pants | Similar Boots | Bag | Similar Scarf\nFor our first night in NY, for pizza at Denino’s on Staten Island, I swapped out my hoodie for a sweater,\nmy bomber for a blazer and my black chunky boots for pointed toe snakeskin boots. SI is pretty casual\nbut I still like to feel like I’m putting in a little effort. I kept on the comfy pants I wore for travel because\nthey read as regular black pants (they’re athleisure but not fleece material.) Perfect for travel.\nA Few More NYC Trip Tips & Favorite Stops\nFree City Views: How could I not include a few more pics when there is literally SO much in NYC. It’s\nthe best. I love love it in small doses. My best recommendations if you’re visiting NYC is to take the free\nferry to Staten Island for the best view of the skyline AND the Statue of Liberty. This was my first time to\ntake it at night and it was stunning. Andrea and I snapped that lovely photo up top.\nLower East Side: Secondly, do not miss doing a tour at the Tenement Museum on the Lower East Side.\nWe’ve done two tours here now (just 1 hour each which leaves plenty of room to fit in other site-seeing)\nand both have been incredible. They offer a special look at how immigrants to that area shaped the\ncommunity and neighborhood. The tours are in the actual buildings where people lived and ran their\nbusinesses. They’re really well done and unique. And while you’re in that area, eat at Russ &\nDaughters like I mentioned and don’t forget to check out Beastie Boys Square at Ludlow + Rivington for\na pic.\nMidtown: We popped by Rockafeller Center after the MoMA to hit up FAO Schwartz so my friend could\nget a specific Jelly Cat stuffy and it was fun to witness that store again for the first time in many many\nyears, snap a pic of 30 Rockafeller Center and peep the ice skaters for a minute.\nBrooklyn: On our Brooklyn day, we did some shopping in the Cobble Hill area, Clare V. and Books Are\nMagic are our normal stops, and had a delicious lunch at Mile End Deli (get the Reuben.) We then did a\nbit of thrifting and got a drink at Royal Palms shuffleboard bar before dinner at Frankie’s. Frankie’s was\nmagical and so delicious and we wound up sitting at a table next to OG lovely blogger Joanna Goddard\nof Cup of Jo. It was a beautifully quintessential Brooklyn moment.\nI hope you get a chance to go soon! It really is the greatest city in the world…\nxo,\nL\nCome say hey over on my Instagram @laurajansenstyle\nThank you to Posy Quarterman, my best photographer, for the outfit pics."}

The post 8 Best Software Documentation Tools for 2025\nappeared first on Work Life by Atlassian.\n\nIn September 1999, the Mars Climate Orbiter burned up upon entering the Red Planet’s atmosphere.\nPoor software and technical documentation practices were the culprits. The system failed to convert\nmeasurements from imperial units to metric units, resulting in a $125 million loss for NASA and a\nseven-year delay in studying Mars’ climate.\nThe fallout from poor software and technical documentation isn’t this dramatic every day, but\nsmall-scale versions of these failures are all too common. Knowledge is often assumed. As long as\nexecutable code is written, design details are commonly overlooked.\nIn many cases, this failure to share important information occurs because developers lack the right\napplications for the job. Software documentation tools streamline information sharing and limit user\nerrors or coding bugs. Read on to explore key types of software documentation and the best tools for\nthe job.\nTypes of software documentation\nTechnical documentation takes many forms, and the specific type depends on the intended audience.\nThe most common types of software documentation fall into four categories.\nDeveloper documentation\nTechnical documentation for developers aims to provide a shared knowledge base for everyone\ninvolved in building software code. This might include:\nRelease notes\nSource code with inline comments\nDetailed descriptions of the software’s architecture.\nDeveloper documentation can also cover application programming interface (API) integration or\ndatabase structure and outline the processes involved in development, software testing, and code\nreview .\nSoftware developers with these resources collaborate more effectively and help the entire team avoid\nassumptions about the functionality of the software or the code behind it.\nProject documentation\nProject documentation outlines practically every aspect of a software project:\nTimelines, milestones, and deliverables\nKey roles and responsibilities on the team\nCritical requirements the finished software product must fulfill\nOther cataloged details may include meeting minutes, technical notes, and risk analyses. While this\ninternal documentation is primarily for developers, it’s also useful for others who need to know how the\nsoftware is progressing or provide input.\nMarketing and sales documentation\nMarketing materials aren’t concerned with software code or the development process. Rather, they\ntarget the application’s end-user appeal and functionality—providing high-level descriptions of product\nfeatures and outlining key user benefits. They might include datasheets highlighting key technical\ndetails and explaining their significance.\nCase studies or white papers also serve as helpful tools for marketing and sales teams. These sales\ndocuments spotlight customer stories and explain real-world scenarios, which can guide conversations\nwith prospects.\nMarketing and sales documentation isn’t limited to written instructions. Brief product demo videos,\ntechnical walkthroughs, or interactive feature overviews may provide more effective, memorable\nexplanations for prospect-facing teams. Teams using a screen capture tool like Loom can easily\nproduce these informative resources for sales prospecting , video marketing content , and more.\nEnd-user documentation\nAnyone who has used an application is familiar with end-user documentation. These are the user\nmanuals, installation guides, and help files designed to improve the user experience in a few ways:\nDetailing key product features\nWalking through important how-tos\nOffering general operating instructions\nUser manuals can also come in the form of online wikis designed to enhance collaboration among\nthose using software applications. These are especially common in open-source programming, where\nthe line between developer and end-user is frequently blurred.\nWhatever the type of documentation your development team is doing, having the proper collaborative\nsoftware tools on hand will drastically improve the process and results.\n8 best software documentation tools for 2025\nThe best modern documentation tools work for a wide range of document types, have a minimal\nlearning curve, and are effective tools for remote teams or in-person collaboration.\nHere are eight top choices across four categories:\nCode documentation tools\nCode documentation is a critical—but often overlooked—aspect of the development process.\nDevelopers tend to assume the code speaks for itself or simply don’t want to bother with the extra time\nand hassle of adding documentation .\nTo combat this, the right code documentation applications should simplify sharing technical notes for\ncodebases. The best tools make it easy to write documentation and share notes in clean, readable\nformats across multiple devices.\n1. GitHub\nGitHub makes it easy to store code and documentation all in one place and edit in plain text or\nMarkdown, a widely popular, nontechnical markup language for simple text formatting.\nFeatures:\nMarkdown formatting: Get Markdown support for README files, comments, issues, pull requests, and\nmore.\nGet Markdown support for README files, comments, issues, pull requests, and more.

Who will take the lead in\nenergy space — China or Russia? Where does India stand? These questions are being increasingly\ndiscussed in the global geopolitical space.\nA cursory assessment points to a multipolar order, where both China and Russia will play a significant\nrole in it. For India, BRICS energy cooperation is broadly advantageous but not without constraints.\nBRICS cooperation spans hydrocarbons, renewables, critical minerals, and energy infrastructure, with\ngrowing emphasis on local-currency trade and alternative payment mechanisms. India assumed the\nBRICS presidency on January 1, succeeding Brazil. It will lead the 11-member bloc with a focus on\n‘Building for Resilience, Innovation, Cooperation, and Sustainability’. There are 10 partner countries\ntoo.\nOver the years, energy cooperation has evolved into a strategic pillar for the bloc, which, according to\nreports, accounts for nearly 50 per cent of global energy production and consumption. This year, the\nalliance is increasingly focused on balancing energy security with a just and inclusive transition to a\nlow-carbon future.\nThe bloc has a ‘Roadmap for Energy Cooperation’ (2025–2030). Its Nuclear Energy Platform,\nestablished in late 2024, was expanded in 2025. It facilitates corporate-level cooperation on nuclear\nprojects as a clean energy source, with financial support from the New Development Bank (NDB).\nThen there is an issue of Energy Transition Financing. According to reports, member-states are actively\npushing for the use of local currencies in energy trade. As the chair, India has invited BRICS nations to\nparticipate in the upcoming energy gathering, scheduled for later this year.\nPower Minister Manohar Lal, at the BRICS Energy Ministers’ Meeting 2025, highlighted energy security\nas one of the most pressing challenges and emphasised the need to strengthen BRICS cooperation to\npromote equitable access to energy resources globally.\nThe bloc supported open, fair and non-discriminatory international energy markets, and encouraged the\nuse of local currencies in energy trade.. The members also emphasised on the importance of resilient\ninfrastructure, diversified energy sources, and critical minerals for clean technologies.\n“From my perspective, BRICS energy cooperation reflects a strategic shift towards a more multipolar\nenergy order rather than the creation of a unified cartel. The initiative is driven by shared interests in\nenergy security, supply diversification, and reducing exposure to Western-dominated institutions and\nfinancial systems,” Umud Shokri, energy strategist and senior visiting fellow at George Mason\nUniversity.\n“The recent expansion of BRICS to include energy-rich states such as Iran and the UAE strengthens its\nresource base, but internal diversity in energy profiles and political priorities mean the bloc functions\nmore as a coordination platform than a tightly integrated alliance,” he said.\nHe agrees that geo-politically, BRICS energy cooperation could accelerate the fragmentation of global\nenergy governance. “By facilitating trade outside dollar-based systems and Western regulatory\nframeworks, it weakens the leverage of sanctions and challenges institutions like the IEA and Bretton\nWoods-linked mechanisms,” he said, adding that “this trend is already visible in Russia’s redirection of\noil and gas exports to Asia and in experiments with non-dollar settlement. While this may enhance\nresilience for participating states and stabilise supplies for emerging economies, it also deepens\ncompetition with G7 countries and could intensify rivalry in energy-rich regions such as the Middle East,\nAfrica, and Central Asia.”\nWho will dominate?\nFurther, a debate is emerging as to who will become a dominant player in BRICS energy order —\nChina or Russia. According to Shokri, “In terms of dominance, China and Russia are likely to shape the\nBRICS energy agenda. China’s role stems from its position as the world’s largest energy consumer, its\nfinancial capacity, and its leadership in clean-energy manufacturing and deployment. Russia, despite\nsanctions, remains a critical supplier of oil, gas, and nuclear technology and uses energy as a strategic\ntool in foreign policy.”\n“Other members contribute in more specialised ways: Brazil through biofuels, Gulf states through\ncapital and reserves, and Iran through hydrocarbons under sanctions pressure. Without strong\ninstitutional constraints, this asymmetry suggests a de facto Sino-Russian leadership rather than equal\ninfluence across members,” he said.\nAmidst all these one also needs to remember that among the BRICS members themselves the bilateral\nrelations vary — for example, India and China vis-a-vis India and Russia.\n“Bilateral relations will play a decisive role in translating BRICS energy cooperation into tangible\noutcomes. Given the bloc’s loose institutional structure and divergent national interests, most progress\nis likely to occur through bilateral or mini-lateral deals nested within the broader BRICS framework,” he\nsaid, adding that examples include Russia-India crude trade, China-Brazil renewable investment, and\npotential China-Gulf infrastructure financing.\n“These arrangements offer flexibility and speed but also limit the emergence of a unified BRICS energy\npolicy, reinforcing the view that the grouping amplifies bilateral leverage rather than replacing it,” he\nsaid.\nIndia’s position\nWhere does India stand in all this? “As a fast-growing energy importer, India benefits from diversified\nsupply options, discounted hydrocarbons, and access to alternative financing and technology channels.\nParticipation strengthens its bargaining power and reduces vulnerability to price shocks and geopolitical\npressure. At the same time, India must manage China’s outsized influence and avoid strategic\nover-dependence on any single partner,” Shokri said.\nThough BRICS provides India with greater strategic autonomy in energy diplomacy, New Delhi will\nneed to up its scale when dealing with China, particularly as India too is giving a push to its green\nenergy business.\nPublished on January 27, 2026"}

We, of course, expect our Trading Partners to do the same.”\nIf implemented, the move could have wide-ranging effects on major South Korean companies that\nexport to the US, such as Hyundai Motor Co., which sent 1.1 million vehicles to America in 2024.\nSouth Korea's presidential Blue House said it hasn't yet received any formal notification or detailed\nexplanation from the US regarding Trump's post on Truth Social. Industry Minister Kim Jung-kwan,\nwho's currently in Canada, plans to travel to the US as soon as possible to discuss the matter with\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, the statement said.\nSeparately, the Blue House plans to hold a meeting chaired by its policy chief involving relevant\nministries on Tuesday.\nThe “special law on strategic investment with the US” is a domestic bill meant to give South Korea's\ngovernment the legal authority to manage and carry out the large-scale investments it pledged to the\nUS under last year's trade deal. The bill was introduced to parliament in late November, which under a\nbilateral memorandum triggered the retroactive cut in auto tariffs from 25% to 15%, effective from the\nstart of that month.\nWhen the bill was submitted in November, Huh Young, a lawmaker with the ruling Democratic Party,\nsaid the parliament is not considering putting the bill on a fast-track process and that no specific\ntimetable has been set for its passage.\n“The National Assembly will conduct a very careful and thorough review of the special law,” Huh, the\nsenior policy floor leader of the ruling party, told reporters on Nov. 26. “If there are any provisions that\ncould potentially undermine the national interest, we hope the ruling and opposition parties will put their\nheads together to ensure the bill passes as a more complete piece of legislation governing investment\nin the US.”\nTrump's announcement marks his latest move to ratchet up trade tensions with allies.

(Submitted by Michael Berdan)\nMichael Berdan, a lawyer and resident of Hanover County involved in immigration advocacy, says he\nstrongly opposes the idea of an ICE facility in his community and says it undermines Pattison’s\nphilanthropic efforts. Pattison is known for his large donations to Canadian medical facilities.\n“A deal advancing fear and family separation inherent in immigration detention would stand in stark\ncontrast to these principles,” he told CBC News.\n“And I think a lot of my neighbours, regardless of political differences, will recognize that this is not the\nbest use for the county.”\nThe Hanover County Board of Supervisors is scheduled to discuss the potential purchase of the\nwarehouse on Wednesday, Jan. 28.

The upcoming Union Budget must focus on reforms that raise\nIndia’s long-term growth potential.\nFirst, efforts should be made to lower the cost of capital. India’s private credit-to-GDP ratio remains low\nfor an economy of its size and ambition. Banks are mandated to keep a significant share of deposits in\ngovernment securities. A calibrated, phased reduction in the statutory liquidity ratio will create\nsubstantial lending capacity, thereby cutting borrowing costs and improving competitiveness. Equally\nimportant is addressing the “missing middle\" in enterprise growth. While India has vibrant startups and\nlarge firms, too few small enterprises scale up to become medium-sized champions. Expanding credit\nguarantees to medium enterprises, with higher coverage for exporters, can crowd in private lending,\nenable scale, and generate employment without distorting market discipline.\nAlso Read | Budget to maintain fiscal rectitude in the face of global storm\nSecond, cities must be treated as engines of growth. Our cities can be drivers of growth, yet weak\nmunicipal finances, fragmented planning, and capacity constraints hold them back. The Budget must\noperationalise the Urban Challenge Fund, tying funding to outcomes: Geographic Information\nSystem-based master planning, modern property tax systems, professional urban staffing, waste\nmanagement, and land value capture. Urban reform is not a municipal issue alone; it is critical for\nIndia’s growth story.\nThird, our trade competitiveness requires an integrated approach to customs and tariffs. While India\nhas improved logistics and port infrastructure, customs processes and tariff structures create\nuncertainty and raise costs. To speed up clearances and lower transaction costs, the Budget must\nadvance customs reforms and move to a risk-based regime. Transparency, trust, and reduced human\ninterface, enabled by digitisation and integrated platforms, can significantly improve our trade\ncompetitiveness. Alongside tariff rationalisation, especially in intermediate goods, these measures will\nstrengthen India's export competitiveness.\nFourth, India must place innovation at the centre of its growth strategy. Innovation is a key determinant\nof productivity and competitiveness. The Budget must advance the Deep Tech Fund of Funds to\nprovide patient capital for cutting-edge technologies. Access to affordable, secure, renewable-powered\ncompute is now as fundamental as access to power or transport infrastructure. Scaling domestic data\ncentre capacity and establishing sovereign compute parks will position India as a global provider of\ndigital and compute services under Indian jurisdiction. Innovation must also be linked to markets. A\nNational Green Public Procurement Programme that aggregates demand for green technologies such\nas low-carbon steel, cement, aluminium, and batteries can help Indian innovations scale. By providing\nassured offtake and reducing early-stage risk, government procurement, when used strategically, is a\npowerful tool for market creation.\nAlso Read | Govt may pitch adventure tourism as revenue model for states in budget\nFifth, India must use tourism and the circular economy to generate jobs and improve quality of life.\nTourism remains one of India’s most underutilised job engines. Declaring 2027 as Visit India Year,\ncombined with deregulation, destination infrastructure, and last-mile connectivity, can create\nlarge-scale employment, especially for youth and women. At the same time, growth must translate into\nbetter living conditions. Productivity losses are real and rising. Cleaner air and water, starting with the\nNational Capital Region, are economic necessities. Strong enforcement, clean mobility, waste reform,\nand water quality management are essential investments in human capital.\nFinally, a National Circular Economy Mission can reduce dependence on imports, create new\nindustries, and generate jobs by turning waste into value. Circular economy parks, demand mandates,\nand blended finance can help scale this transition.\nThe message for the Budget is clear: focus on capital, cities, trade, innovation, and quality of life. These\nare not competing priorities; together, they form the backbone of sustained high growth.\nAmitabh Kant is chairperson, Fairfax Centre for Free Enterprise. The views expressed are personal."}

Niche\nAI stocks have performed well, but the focus may s…\n\nBloomberg\nLive Events\nPerformance or Punishment\nBloomberg\nas a Reliable and Trusted News Source Addas a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\nInvestors have made a pile of money recently by focusing on niche stocks in the AI trade. Earnings\nfrom some of the world's biggest technology companies this week will offer an indication of whether\nthey should stick to that strategy in 2026.The Magnificent Seven tech giants - Alphabet Inc.,\nAmazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. - have\nled the stock market higher for much of the past three years. But that reversed at the end of 2025 as\nWall Street grew skeptical of the hundreds of billions of dollars the companies are spending to develop\nartificial intelligence and when the returns on those investments will materialize.An index tracking the\ngroup closed at a record on Oct. 29, and since then the shares of five of the seven members are down\nand trailing the S&P; 500 Index.Alphabet, which has soared almost 20% during that stretch, and\nAmazon.com are the only stocks in the green.In response, traders have been piling into the recipients\nof Big Tech's largesse. Memory and storage maker Sandisk Corp. is up more than 130% since the\nMagnificent Seven index hit an all-time high and then retreated, while Micron Technology Inc. has\njumped 76% and Western Digital Corp. has gained gained 67% in that time. Power producers and\ngenerator makers have also advanced, and even materials companies are outperforming on\nexpectations for accelerating economic growth and the appeal of cheaper valuations.\"Tech has\nbecome more of a show-me story,\" said Darrell Cronk, chief investment officer, wealth and investment\nmanagement at Wells Fargo, which manages $2.3 trillion. \"If Big Tech can continue to deliver, I think\ncapital will start flowing in tech's direction again.\"Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Tesla report earnings\non Wednesday, followed by Apple on Thursday. Alphabet, by far the best performer among the\nMagnificent Seven last year, reports on Feb. 4, while number two Nvidia's results land on Feb. 25.\nAmazon.com reports on Feb. 5.The results will offer a glimpse into the health of industries ranging from\ncloud computing and electronic devices to software and digital advertising. The group is expected to\npost 20% profit growth for the fourth quarter, which would be the slowest pace since early 2023,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. So the companies are under pressure to show\nthat the vast sums they've committed to capital expenditures are starting to pay off in a bigger\nway.\"We're no longer in an environment where companies can beat by 1% to 2% and continue\nspending on capex and get rewarded,\" said Chris Maxey, managing director and chief market strategist\nat Wealthspire, which has $580 billion in assets.AI growth is most visible in cloud businesses like\nMicrosoft’s Azure, which rents out computing power and is benefiting from a surge in demand from\ncorporate customers who are training AI models and running services. In Microsoft’s fiscal first quarter,\nwhich ended in September, Azure revenue rose 39% as demand continued to outstrip supply. Wall\nStreet is expecting 36% growth for Azure in Microsoft’s fiscal second quarter.Adding computing\ncapacity isn’t cheap. Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta are expected to spend roughly $475 billion\nin capital expenditures in 2026, up from $230 billion in 2024. Not surprisingly, investors want to start\nseeing a return on those investments. Without it, companies risk getting punished, according to Clayton\nAllison, portfolio manager at Prime Capital Financial.“If they don’t hit their growth targets, they’re going\nto get hit hard,” said Allison, whose firm has $40 billion in assets under management. “If we do start to\nsee an ROI, increased profitability despite increased capex, that would start to massage some of these\nfears.”Investors got a sense of what punishment looks like on Oct. 29, when Meta Platforms projected “\nnotably larger ” capital expenditures in 2026 with no details on how the spending will lead to profits. The\nstock dropped 11% the following day and remains down 17% from an August peak. Facebook’s\nparent’s fourth-quarter earnings per share is expected to rise less than 2% from a year ago to $8.16,\nwhile revenue is projected to jump 21%, according to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.Of\ncourse, it’s very hard for investors to avoid the tech giants even if they want to, considering their\nmassive position in the S&P; 500. Counting Alphabet’s dual shares, the group represents eight of the\nnine largest weights in the index and more than a third of it combined.Besides, it’s doubtful that many\nshareholders would want to escape the group anyway considering its ability to generate profits at a\nfaster clip than the rest of the market. The 493 companies in the S&P; 500 that aren’t in the Magnificent\nSeven are projected to deliver earnings growth of just 8% in the fourth quarter, according to Bloomberg\nIntelligence, which is significantly slower than what’s expected from Big Tech.In addition, the stocks\naren’t historically expensive. The Magnificent Seven index is trading at 28 times profits expected over\nthe next 12 months, below previous peaks and roughly in line with its average over the past decade,\naccording to data compiled by Bloomberg. Nvidia shares, for example, have soared 1,184% since the\nend of 2022, yet they’re priced at 24 times anticipated profits, slightly above the S&P; 500’s multiple of\n22.All that being said, investors are waiting for these stocks to snap out of their slumber. To do that, the\ncompanies need to deliver on growth before long.“I don’t know that this is the quarter when those\nquestions have to be answered,” said Wells Fargo’s Cronk. “But the market will look at this earnings\nseason as an important progress milestone.”"}

Born in 1961 as a\ntheme park novelty at Tokyo’s Tama Tech, this pint-sized motorcycle earned its name when a journalist\nwatched adults folding themselves onto the tiny Z100 prototype — like circus monkeys, as he put it.\nWhat started as children’s entertainment morphed into something Honda kept refining year after year,\nuntil the Monkey became one of those bikes people just couldn’t quit.\nFast forward to today and the 2026 Monkey 125 shows up with the same 124cc air-cooled single, same\nfive-speed gearbox, same blend of retro charm and modern convenience, but now wearing three fresh\nnew paint schemes.\nPhoto: Honda\nThree Fresh Takes\nThe 2026 model year brings an understated Mat Gun Powder Black Metallic colorway, a Knight Silver\nMetallic with Millennium Red that leans into Honda’s heritage, and, most significantly, a Pearl\nHimalayas White variant with Banana Yellow accents. That last combo acknowledges what everyone’s\nbeen thinking since the modern Monkey returned in 2018 — a bike named Monkey deserves\nbanana-inspired livery. Beyond the paint, there’s a round LCD display that winks when you turn the\nignition on and full LED lighting throughout.\nPhoto: Honda\nBuilt for Smiles, Not Speed\nUnder that peanut tank sits Honda’s Euro 5+ compliant 124cc single putting out 9.25 hp at 6,750 rpm\nand 7.89 lb.ft of torque at 5,500 rpm. The manual clutch and five-speed transmission give you enough\ncontrol to feel engaged, while the bike’s 231-pound curb weight and 30.55-inch seat height mean nearly\nanyone can swing a leg over and get comfortable immediately.\nThe steel mono-backbone frame pairs with USD forks up front (100mm travel) and twin rear shocks\n(102mm travel) that handle urban roads better than you’d expect from a bike this small. Twelve-inch\ncast aluminum wheels wrapped in chunky 120/80 and 130/80 tires look the part and provide enough\ngrip for any type of riding.\nIMU-controlled ABS on the front 220mm disc adds real-world safety, and with 6.89″ of ground\nclearance, the Monkey can handle more varied terrain than its dimensions suggest. Top speed hovers\naround 57mph.\nPhoto: Honda\nAccessories to Boot\nHonda’s accessory lineup for the Monkey includes practical additions like a chrome rear luggage\ncarrier, left-side canvas pannier with waterproof inner bag, heated grips, USB charging socket, and an\noptional clock/gear position display. There’s also an immobilizer alarm if you’re parking somewhere\nsketchy.\nPhoto: Honda\nSpec Sheet\nModel: 2026 Honda Monkey 125\nEngine: 124cc air-cooled single-cylinder, SOHC\nPower: 9.25 hp\nTorque: 7.89 lb.ft\nTransmission: 5-speed manual\nFuel Capacity: 5.6L\nSeat Height: 30.55″\nCurb Weight: 231lbs\nBrakes: 220mm front disc (IMU ABS), 190mm rear disc\nSuspension: USD fork (100mm) / Twin shock (102mm)\nWheels: 12-inch cast aluminum\nPricing & Availability\nThe 2026 Honda Monkey 125 is available now in the UK for £4,199 (~$5,740).

It had indicated it would be\nconnected to India’s power infrastructure by December 20…\n\nMUMBAI : A timely connectivity to the Indian power grid could help Adani Power Ltd offset some of the\npotential risks to its financials if its $1-billion-a-year power supply deal with Bangladesh sours, after\nIndia’s eastern neighbour accused the Ahmedabad-based conglomerate of charging above-market\nrates.\nA committee set up by Bangladesh’s interim government to review power supply deals signed under\nthe now-ousted Sheikh Hasina regime has accused Adani Power of exporting electricity priced about\n50% above market rates. Mint has seen a copy of the report.\nWhile Adani's coal-fired plant in Jharkhand's Godda is currently linked only to the Bangladesh grid, the\ncompany has received approval to connect to the Indian grid, too. The company had indicated that it\nwould be connected to India’s power infrastructure by December 2025, but that hasn’t been completed\nyet.\n“We are expecting that it will get connected by December 2025,\" S.B. Khyalia, chief executive officer\n(CEO) of Adani Power, said in an analyst call on 30 October.\nThe Adani Group did not comment on whether the plant is connected to the grid yet, and if not, by when\nit would be completed. A person aware of the development said that grid connectivity was imminent,\nespecially since all the approvals have been received.\nThe company can supply power to India only under two conditions – if there is persistently no\nscheduling of power by Bangladesh, or if the country defaults on its payments, Khyalia said in the\nOctober call.\nOnly partial relief\nConnectivity with the Indian grid will only partly offset any potential margin impact to Adani Power if\nBangladesh terminates the deal. This is because the company supplies power to India’s neighbour at\n$0.135 per unit ( ■12.3), the 20 January report of Bangladesh's National Review Committee (NRC)\nshowed.\nIn comparison, Adani Power sold electricity in the merchant market in India at an average price of\n■5.37 per unit during the first six months of FY26, as per an investor presentation from October 2025.\nAdani Power has been supplying thermal power to Bangladesh from its Godda plant since 2023 under\na 25-year deal inked in 2017. The company makes over ■8,300 crore a year in revenue and over\n■4,800 crore in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (Ebitda) from the deal, as\ndisclosed by its management in an analyst call on 1 May, 2025.\nThis translates to over 14% of the company’s FY25 revenue and nearly a fifth of its Ebitda that year,\nmaking the deal vital for the company, and in turn, the Adani Group.\nAlso Read | Adani order lifts GE Vernova—but it comes at a price\nOne immediate fallout if Bangladesh were to scrap the Adani Power project would be on the company’s\ncash flow. Adani Power is the cash cow of the Adani Group, which has 13 listed companies. Adani\nPower generated ■18,711 crore in free cash from operations in the year ended March 2025, a tad\nhigher than the ■17,200 crore generated by Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone.\nThe Adani Group did not comment on what the potential financial impact of a possible termination of\nthe deal would be.\n“Bangladesh pays a relatively high tariff of 14.87 taka per unit, higher than alternative sources, leading\nto scrutiny by a national review committee that has alleged corruption, collusion, and fraud in the\noriginal deal signed under the Sheikh Hasina government,\" analysts at brokerage JM Financial noted in\na report on 2 January. Bangladesh has also accused Adani Power of not passing on Indian tax\nincentives that should have lowered tariffs, and has disputed coal cost calculations, alleging prices\nhigher than market levels, the analysts noted.\nCash flows from the 1.6GW Godda plant remain exposed to payment delays, power purchase\nagreement renegotiation risk, and legal uncertainty following scrutiny by the Bangladesh High Court,\ndespite recent clearance of past dues, the analysts added.\nCost inflation allegations\nA five-member NRC, which was set up by the interim government of Bangladesh to review power\npurchase agreements signed with six independent companies, reported that the country was paying\nmore to Adani under the deal than what it should.\n“For the Adani Godda imported power contract, we conservatively estimate overpricing of 4-5 cents per\nkWh, which means the price being paid is roughly 50% higher than what it should be,\" the NRC noted\nin its report.\n“Benchmarking undertaken by the NRC shows that the approved tariff for Adani was the highest among\ncomparable electricity import contracts from India at the time of signing and that subsequent tariff\nescalation exceeded peer contracts by a substantial margin,\" it further noted. “This divergence\nindicates that elevated costs were not an inherent feature of cross-border power trade, but the outcome\nof specific contractual choices.\"\nThe five-member panel, which authored the report, consists of Moyeenul Islam Chowdhury, a former\nhigh court judge; Abdul Hasib Chowdhury, a professor at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and\nTechnology; Ali Ashfaq, a former partner of KPMG Bangladesh; Mushtaq Husain Khan, professor of\neconomics at SOAS University of London and Zahid Hussain, former lead economist at the World Bank\nDhaka office.\nAlso Read | SC scraps customs duty on SEZ power, Adani Power wins relief\nEmails and text messages to Khan and Ashfaq went unanswered.\nA spokesperson for the Adani Group said that it has not received any communication regarding the\nreview committee report and neither the said report has been made available to the company. Hence,\nthey declined to offer any specific comment regarding the findings of the report. “At no point in time\nwere we approached by any Bangladesh authority to provide our viewpoint or share any inputs,\" the\nspokesperson said.\n“Adani Power is a key partner in Bangladesh’s energy sector, meeting about 10% of the country’s\npower demand. We supply reliable, high quality and amongst the most competitively priced (as\ncompared to similar imported coal-based plants) power. We have continued to honour our supply\ncommitment despite large receivables, when many other generators have cut back or even stopped\nsupplies,\" the spokesperson further said, adding that the company urges the Bangladesh government\nto liquidate its dues at the earliest as it was impacting the company’s operations.\nPending dues from Bangladesh had reached as high as $800 million last year. However, consistent\npayments from the country in recent months narrowed this deficit to only 15 days of delayed payments\nas of the October analyst call.\nAdani Group’s latest setback in Bangladesh comes after last week’s development, where the US\nSecurities and Exchange Commission sought permission from a federal court to personally email\nsummons to Gautam Adani and his nephew, Sagar Adani, after the US market regulator claimed that\nIndia’s ministry of law and justice rejected its request twice in the last 14 months. The news led to Adani\nGroup’s shares losing a tenth of their value on Friday, translating into a market capitalization loss of\nover ■1.1 trillion.\nOn 20 November 2024, US prosecutors indicted eight executives, claiming $250 million in bribes were\npaid to unnamed Indian officials in exchange for favorable terms on solar power contracts awarded to\nAdani Green Energy Ltd and Azure Power Global Ltd, a New Delhi-headquartered firm.\nAdani Group has denied any wrongdoing and said the allegations against its directors are baseless."}

And, for public or social media misconduct, there is a fine of $2,000 to $5,000, again\nbased on severity.\nIn addition, there are fines for damaging university or team property ($3,000 plus the repair cost); losing\nteam technology or equipment ($1,000 plus cost of replacement); and for misuse or destruction of\nathletic training equipment ($500 to $2,000).\nSanders’ notes added that there will be an appeal process for the students when they are fined.\nAlthough the student-athletes are not technically employees, a BuffZone source said it’s permissible to\nfine the players because the fines are not tied to their name, image and likeness (NIL), revenue share\nor licensing agreements; the fines aren’t related to on-field performance; and they are strictly for\nviolations of team rules.\nThe source also said other programs around the country have similar violation systems and what\nSanders has implemented is “not something unique to CU.”\nMoney collected by the fines will go to CU athletic department operating funds.\nNew corners coach\nSanders has hired Aaron Fletcher as the Buffs’ new cornerbacks coach. He won’t be replacing anyone,\nhowever. Rather, he will work alongside Kevin Mathis, who has been the Buffs’ corners coach for three\nyears and is now working with nickel backs and as the defensive pass game coordinator.\nFletcher was the co-defensive coordinator and cornerbacks coach Abilene Christian in 2024. He\npreviously coached the secondary at Arizona State (2022), Missouri (2021), Tulsa (2015-20) and\nHouston Baptist (2012-14).\nFletcher also worked as a defensive analyst at Mississippi in 2023 and a training camp intern with the\nNFL’s Cincinnati Bengals and Denver Broncos."}

His\ncompany, based in Bangalore, India, supplies the equipment behind mobile phone networks and\nbroadband connections. \"Essentially, we provide the electronics that carry traffic across telecom\nnetworks,\" he says. That requires special chips designed for telecoms tasks. \"Telecom chips are\nfundamentally different from consumer or smartphone chips. They handle massive volumes of data\ncoming simultaneously from hundreds of thousands of users. \"These networks cannot go down.\nReliability, redundancy and fail-safe operation are critical - the chip architecture has to support that,\"\nRoy says. Tejas designs many of those chips in India, a country well known for its expertise in\ndesigning computer chips (also known as semiconductors). It's estimated that 20% of the world's\nsemiconductor engineers are in India. \"Almost every major global chip company has its largest or\nsecond-largest design centre in India, working on cutting-edge products,\" says Amitesh Kumar Sinha,\nJoint Secretary of India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. What India lacks is\ncompanies that manufacture semiconductors. So Indian firms like Tejas Neworks design the chips they\nneed in India, but then have them manufactured overseas.\nThe weakness of that system was exposed during Covid, when the supply of chips dried up and\ncompanies in all sorts of industries had to scale back production. \"The pandemic made it clear that\nsemiconductor manufacturing is too concentrated globally, and that concentration carries serious risk,\"\nRoy says. That spurred India to develop its own semiconductor industry. \"Covid showed us how fragile\nglobal supply chains can be. If one part of the world shuts down, electronics manufacturing everywhere\nis disrupted,\" says Sinha. \"That's why India is developing its own semiconductor ecosystem to reduce\nrisk and increase resilience,\" he adds. He is leading government efforts to develop the semiconductor\nindustry, which involves identifying parts of the production process where India can compete.\nGetty Images Computer chips are made by etching circuits on to silicon wafers\nThere are several steps in making a computer chip. First design, where India is already strong. The\nsecond stage is wafer fabrication, where thin sheets of silicon have circuits etched on to them by\nextremely expensive machines in huge factories known as semiconductor \"fabs\". That part of the\nprocess, particularly for the most sophisticated chips, is dominated by companies in Taiwan, with China\ntrying to catch up. In the third stage those large silicon wafers are sliced up into individual chips,\npackaged in protective casing, connected to contacts and tested. That third stage, known as\nOutsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (Osat), is the part of the production process targeted by\nIndia. \"Assembly, test and packaging are easier to start than fabs and that is where India is moving\nfirst,\" says Ashok Chandak, president of India Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA). He\nsays that several such plants will \"enter mass production\" this year.\nGetty Images China is building up its semiconductor industry\nFounded in 2023, Kaynes Semicon is the first company to get a semiconductor plant up and running\nwith support from the Indian government. Kaynes Semicon invested $260m (£270m) in a factory to\nassemble and test computer chips in the northwestern state of Gujarat. Production started in November\nof last year. \"Packaging is not just putting a chip in a box. It's a 10 to 12 step manufacturing process,\"\nsays Raghu Panicker, CEO of Kaynes Semicon. \"That's why packaging and testing are as critical as\nmaking the chip itself without this stage, the wafer is useless to industry.\" His facility will not be making\nthe most advanced computer chips found in the latest mobile phones or used for training AI. \"India does\nnot need the most complex datacentre or AI chips on day one. That is not where our demand is, and\nthat is not where our strength lies today,\" Panicker says. Instead, they will be the kind of chips used in\ncars, telecoms and the defence industry. \"These are not glamorous chips, but they are economically\nand strategically far more important for India. You build an industry by first serving your own market.\nComplexity can come later. Scale has to come first,\" he adds.\nIt's been a steep learning curve for Kaynes Semicon. \"We had never built a semiconductor cleanroom\nin India before. We had never installed this equipment before. We had never trained people for this\nbefore,\" Panicker says. \"Semiconductors demand a level of discipline, documentation and process\ncontrol that is very different from traditional manufacturing. That cultural shift is as important as the\ntechnical one.\" Getting staff trained has been a huge challenge. \"Training takes time. You cannot\nshortcut five years of experience into six months. That is the single biggest bottleneck,\" Panicker says."}

Exploring Nocturnal Surveillance\nThe answer is nuanced: While checking trail cameras at night can provide immediate insights, it also\ncarries the risk of disturbing wildlife and potentially compromising your hunting area. Consider the\npotential downsides before implementing nighttime checks.\nIntroduction: The Allure of the Nocturnal Glimpse\nTrail cameras have revolutionized wildlife monitoring and hunting. They offer a silent, unobtrusive\nwindow into the lives of animals, capturing behaviors and movements that would otherwise remain\nunseen. As technology advances, so does the temptation to access this information instantly. Should\nyou check trail cameras at night? This is a question many hunters and wildlife enthusiasts grapple with,\nbalancing the desire for real-time data with the potential negative impacts on the very animals they\nseek to observe. This article will delve into the pros and cons of nighttime trail camera checks,\nproviding a comprehensive guide to making informed decisions.\nUnderstanding Trail Camera Technology\nTrail cameras employ various technologies, primarily infrared (IR) and white flash, to capture images\nand videos.\nInfrared (IR): These cameras use infrared light, which is invisible to most animals, to illuminate the\nscene. This is the preferred choice for covert surveillance, as it minimizes disturbance.\nThese cameras use infrared light, which is invisible to most animals, to illuminate the scene. This is the\npreferred choice for covert surveillance, as it minimizes disturbance. White Flash: These cameras emit\na visible white light, similar to a traditional camera flash. While providing clearer, more detailed images,\nthey can spook animals and potentially alter their behavior.\nThe trigger speed of a trail camera, the time it takes to capture an image after motion detection, is\nanother crucial factor. Faster trigger speeds ensure you capture more details, especially of quickly\nmoving animals.\nPotential Benefits of Nighttime Checks\nThere are specific situations where checking trail cameras at night may offer advantages:\nImmediate Security Concerns: If the camera is used for security purposes, a nighttime check might be\nnecessary to investigate potential intrusions.\nIf the camera is used for security purposes, a nighttime check might be necessary to investigate\npotential intrusions. Monitoring Specific Nocturnal Animals: Certain species, like owls or bats, are\nprimarily active at night. Checking the camera at night allows for immediate confirmation of their\npresence and behavior.\nCertain species, like owls or bats, are primarily active at night. Checking the camera at night allows for\nimmediate confirmation of their presence and behavior. Assessing Damage: If you suspect damage\nfrom wildlife activity, like beaver damming or animal damage to crops, immediate nighttime checks can\nprovide timely information.\nIf you suspect damage from wildlife activity, like beaver damming or animal damage to crops,\nimmediate nighttime checks can provide timely information. Troubleshooting: Camera malfunction after\ndark can often require an immediate check.\nThe Risks of Nighttime Disturbances\nWhile the allure of immediate information is strong, it’s crucial to acknowledge the potential negative\nconsequences of disturbing wildlife:\nIncreased Stress Levels: Unexpected encounters with humans at night can cause significant stress for\nanimals, especially during vulnerable periods like breeding or foraging.\nUnexpected encounters with humans at night can cause significant stress for animals, especially during\nvulnerable periods like breeding or foraging.

Scheduled Checks: Establish a\nregular schedule for checking cameras during daylight hours, minimizing the need for nighttime\ninterventions.\nChoosing the Right Trail Camera for Your Needs\nThe type of camera you choose can significantly impact the need for nighttime checks. Consider these\nfactors:\nImage Quality: Higher resolution cameras provide clearer images, potentially reducing the need for\nfrequent checks to identify animals.\nHigher resolution cameras provide clearer images, potentially reducing the need for frequent checks to\nidentify animals. Detection Range: Cameras with longer detection ranges can capture activity from a\ngreater distance, reducing the need to approach the camera closely.\nCameras with longer detection ranges can capture activity from a greater distance, reducing the need\nto approach the camera closely. Trigger Speed: Faster trigger speeds ensure you capture more details,\npotentially reducing the need for immediate review of footage.\nFeature Importance for Nighttime Checks Benefit —————- ———————————\n———————————————————————– Cellular Enabled High Reduces the need for\nphysical checks. Trigger Speed Medium Captures more details, potentially delaying need for immediate\nreview. IR Flash Type High Low-Glow or No-Glow reduces disturbance.\nConclusion: Weighing the Benefits Against the Risks\nShould you check trail cameras at night? Ultimately, the decision depends on your specific needs and\nthe potential impact on wildlife. While immediate information can be tempting, prioritizing animal welfare\nand long-term monitoring success is paramount. Employing alternative technologies and adopting\nresponsible practices will ensure that your trail camera activities benefit both you and the wildlife you\nobserve.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nCan animals see the infrared flash on a trail camera?\nWhile true no-glow infrared flashes are invisible to most animals, some animals may be able to detect\nthe slight red glow emitted by low-glow IR cameras. Consider this when placing your camera in\nsensitive areas.\nHow often should I check my trail cameras?\nThe frequency of checks depends on your specific goals. For general monitoring, checking every 2-4\nweeks is usually sufficient. For hunting purposes, you may want to check more frequently, but always\nprioritize minimizing disturbance.\nWhat is the best time of day to check trail cameras?\nMidday is generally the best time to check trail cameras, as animal activity is often at its lowest during\nthese hours. This minimizes the risk of disturbing wildlife.\nWhat should I wear when checking trail cameras?\nWear scent-free clothing and consider using scent elimination sprays to minimize your odor.\nCamouflage clothing can also help you blend in with the environment.\nHow can I prevent animals from damaging my trail cameras?\nUse a protective metal case to shield the camera from chewing and other damage.

Pitchers and\ncatchers will report to Camelback Ranch on Feb. 13 for their first workout of the new season, and the\nremainder of the squad will have their first workout Feb. 17.\nThis year’s team still holds plenty of the core members from their 2025 World Series triumph over the\nToronto Blue Jays, but a few new faces will be around this year.\nAll-Stars Kyle Tucker and Edwin Diaz are the two biggest names set to make their first appearances in\nDodger blue this season, and fans are sure to get a first look at the duo during spring training.\nOther than them, though, several players are still vying for a spot on the roster and looking to get a real\nshot in the big leagues.\nLos Angeles Dodgers Shohei Ohtani takes third base on a single by Tommy Edman against the\nArizona Diamondbacks in the first inning during a spring training game at Camelback Ranch-Glendale\nin Phoenix on March 10, 2025.\nWho Can Make the Dodgers’ Opening Day Roster?\nSeveral players from last season are fighting for a roster spot, most notably Alex Freeland and\nHyeseong Kim, who are the most likely candidates to fill in the hole at second base if Tommy Edman is\nto miss the beginning of the season.\nAdditionally, Ryan Ward is looking for a spot on the team after his electric performances in Triple-A last\nseason.

Getty\nImages\nHe had the winningest managerial record in MLB history, plus a World Series ring from the Dodgers’\npandemic-altered 2020 championship.\nBut he was also “kind of thinking, ‘How much longer do I want to do this?’” he recalled, after early\npostseason eliminations in 2022 and 2023 had prompted external questions about his job security and\nan internal period of self-reflection within him.\n“It was like, ‘What am I doing this for?’” Roberts told The California Post recently, sitting down for lunch\nat a beachside restaurant near his offseason home in San Diego. “I love the question, ‘What are you\nchasing?’ And I was there at home, [after] you lose, and you’re like, ‘What am I chasing?’ Am I chasing\na championship? We already won one. Is that going to bring me joy and fulfillment? I didn’t have an\nanswer.”\n6 Dave Roberts gives an interview after the Los Angeles Dodgers Workouts day at Tokyo Dome on\nMarch 17, 2025 in Tokyo, Japan Getty Images\n“That’s unsettling,” he added, “when you don’t have an answer to, ‘what are you chasing?’”\nTwo years later, all those doubts have washed away now.\nEntering 2026, Roberts is at the pinnacle of his managerial career, on the verge of a World Series\nthree-peat that he feels has validated the “steadfast [way] in how we’ve done things” over the last\ndecade.\n6 Roberts celebrates after beating the Toronto Blue Jays in Game 7 of the World Series, Sunday, Nov.\n2, 2025, in Toronto. AP\n“We’ve been very consistent,” he said, citing everything from front-office and ownership stability to the\nculture the Dodgers have cultivated in their clubhouse. “I think that for us to look back on how we’ve\nwon, I feel proud of that.”\nHe has felt a newfound embrace from the fan base, letting go of old frustrations –– “There’s times that I\nwas resentful,” he admitted of the public criticisms he took earlier in his Dodgers tenure –– while\nexpressing a deep gratitude for the way “they show up to support us every night.”\n“I’d rather have fans that are passionate and care, even at the cost of me getting booed at home in a\nWorld Series,” he joked. “Which, I think I might hold the record with that.”\nMost of all, Roberts has found a renewed satisfaction in his work. A purpose, he explained, that goes\nbeyond wins and losses and championship rings.\n“Now, I just feel I’m chasing happiness, joy and success –– whatever that means,” he said. “It’s\ncertainly championships. But there’s a lot of other parts for me that I feel confident that I’m achieving.”\nRoberts points back to last October’s title defense, highlighting the “complete buy-in” he received from\nthe roster while managing an all-hands-on-deck pitching staff and shuffling players in and out of the\nlineup.\n6 Shohei Ohtani and Dave Roberts celebrate after their World Series win in 2025. AP\n“Not one time was I questioned on my decision-making [by the players], which in turn would question\ntheir commitment to the team,” he said. “They all felt their time was coming. They all felt that their roles\nwere really valued. I don’t think that any head coach or manager can say that.”\nHe cites his own growth in the dugout, and the way he feels his decision-making has “really slowed\ndown” after a decade on the top step.\n“I think that with Father Time as an athlete, there’s a bell curve,” he said. “But with coaching, your best\nyears are with experience and as you get older. That’s the irony. And I do feel that I’m much more wise\n… At 53, I feel like I’m just scratching the surface.”\n6 Roberts is at the pinnacle of his managerial career being on the verge of a World Series three-peat.\nGetty Images\nAnd as he begins a new four-year contract he signed last spring (which came with a record-setting $8.1\nmillion annual salary), Roberts is no longer grappling his questions about his professional future.\n“I’m not gonna say I’m going to manage for as long as Tommy [Lasorda] and Walt Alston,” he said,\nreferencing his Hall-of-Fame predecessors’ 20-plus-year tenures with the club. “But I don’t see myself\ngoing anywhere for a while.”\nInstead, the former big-league outfielder has made lifestyle changes he hopes will extend his\nmanagerial prime. Late last season, he overhauled his diet and almost entirely cut out alcohol. Over the\ncourse of this offseason, he got noticeably trimmer while shedding 12 pounds.\n6 “I think that for us to look back on how we’ve won, I feel proud of that,” Roberts said. IMAGN IMAGES\nvia Reuters Connect\n“I’m in the best shape of my managerial career,” Roberts joked, while sipping on a purple beet and\ncarrot detox juice and picking at a rice bowl with chicken.\n“It was in August, probably after we got swept in Pittsburgh, where I was like, ‘I need to make a change\n… It was a look in the mirror moment, where I said I was fat, I didn’t shave in three days, and I was like,\n‘I’m not doing this.’”\nAfter all, Roberts didn’t want to be one of those “leaders or coaches that sort of let themselves go,\nwhere you look tired and beat up” (and no, he’s not naming names).\n“I do think there’s an optics part of it,” he said. “If I come in looking healthy, and my energy is up, then I\ndo think it can reflect [in] the clubhouse.”\nHe didn’t want to end up back in the place he was a couple years ago, either, wondering what he was\nchasing in a job that –– even beyond all the recent winning –– has him reinvigorated in both body and\nmind now.\n“I’m enjoying the heck out of this,” he said. “I’m just re-energized. I really am.”"}

Unveiling the Mysteries of Mitsukurina owstoni\nThe goblin shark, Mitsukurina owstoni, is an incredibly rare deep-sea shark known for its bizarre,\nelongated snout, protruding jaws, and pinkish skin, making it a truly unique and enigmatic creature of\nthe deep.\nIntroduction to a Living Fossil\nThe goblin shark ( Mitsukurina owstoni) is a fascinating creature. It often called a “living fossil” because\nit represents a lineage that stretches back millions of years. This deep-sea dweller offers a rare glimpse\ninto the evolutionary history of sharks. While sightings are infrequent, the goblin shark sparks intrigue\nand fuels ongoing research into the biodiversity of our oceans. What is the rare goblin shark besides a\nstrange-looking fish? It’s a window into the past.\nPhysical Characteristics: A Face Only a Mother Could Love\nThe goblin shark’s most distinctive feature is its elongated, paddle-shaped snout. This strange\nappendage is thought to be covered in electroreceptors, allowing it to detect the faint electrical fields of\nprey hidden in the dark depths. Other notable physical characteristics include:\nProtrusible Jaws: Its jaws are highly protrusible, meaning they can extend far forward from the mouth to\nseize prey.\nIts jaws are highly protrusible, meaning they can extend far forward from the mouth to seize prey.\nPinkish Skin: The pink color comes from visible blood vessels near the surface of its translucent skin.\nThe pink color comes from visible blood vessels near the surface of its translucent skin. Flattened\nBody: The shark has a somewhat flattened body shape, further distinguishing it from more streamlined\nshark species.\nThe shark has a somewhat flattened body shape, further distinguishing it from more streamlined shark\nspecies. Small Fins: It has relatively small fins for its size, suggesting it is not a fast swimmer.\nHabitat and Distribution: Lords of the Abyss\nGoblin sharks are found in deep-sea environments worldwide, though their distribution is patchy and\npoorly understood. They have been recorded in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, typically at\ndepths ranging from 270 to 960 meters (890 to 3,150 feet), but some have been found even deeper.\nDeep-Sea Dwellers: They primarily inhabit the upper to mid-continental slopes.\nThey primarily inhabit the upper to mid-continental slopes. Global, but Rare: While globally distributed,\nthey are rarely encountered, making research challenging.\nWhile globally distributed, they are rarely encountered, making research challenging. Avoidance of\nSunlight: Their preference for deep water reflects their adaptation to a lightless environment.\nDiet and Hunting Strategies: An Ambush Predator\nThe goblin shark is believed to be an ambush predator, using its electroreceptive snout to detect prey\nand its protrusible jaws to snatch unsuspecting animals. Their diet likely consists of:\nDeep-Sea Fish: Various species of bony fish found at depth.\nVarious species of bony fish found at depth. Crustaceans: Deep-sea crabs and other crustaceans.\nDeep-sea crabs and other crustaceans. Cephalopods: Squid and other cephalopods.\nTheir hunting strategy leverages the element of surprise in the dark ocean.\nEvolutionary Significance: A Living Relic\nThe goblin shark belongs to the Mitsukurinidae family, a lineage that dates back approximately 125\nmillion years. It is the only extant member of this ancient family, making it a crucial species for\nunderstanding shark evolution. Studying what is the rare goblin shark can unlock insights into how\nsharks have adapted and changed over vast stretches of geological time.\nConservation Status: Data Deficient\nThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists the goblin shark as “Least Concern,”\nhowever, this classification is based on limited data. The rarity of sightings and the challenges of\nstudying deep-sea species make it difficult to assess the true population size and potential threats.\nIncidental capture in deep-sea fisheries poses a potential risk. More research is needed to determine\nthe conservation status of this enigmatic shark.\nCommon Misconceptions about Goblin Sharks\nMany misconceptions surround the goblin shark, largely due to its unusual appearance and the lack of\ninformation available about its behavior. Some common misconceptions include:\nAggressive Nature: They are often portrayed as aggressive, but there is no evidence to suggest they\nare dangerous to humans.\nThey are often portrayed as aggressive, but there is no evidence to suggest they are dangerous to\nhumans. Exclusively Deep-Sea: While primarily found in deep water, they have occasionally been\nobserved closer to the surface.\nWhile primarily found in deep water, they have occasionally been observed closer to the surface. Active\nPredators: They are thought to be ambush predators rather than active hunters.\nWhat is the rare goblin shark, and Why Is It So Important to Study It?\nThe rarity of goblin sharks makes each specimen and sighting crucial for scientific study. By studying\ngoblin sharks, scientists can learn more about:\nDeep-sea ecosystems: Understanding the role of this apex predator in the deep-sea food web.\nUnderstanding the role of this apex predator in the deep-sea food web. Shark evolution: Gaining\ninsights into the evolutionary history of sharks and the Mitsukurinidae family.\nGaining insights into the evolutionary history of sharks and the Mitsukurinidae family. Sensory\nadaptations: Exploring the function of their electroreceptive snout and other unique sensory\nadaptations.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat exactly does “protrusible jaws” mean for a goblin shark?\nProtrusible jaws mean the goblin shark’s jaws are not rigidly attached to its skull. They can be rapidly\nextended forward to capture prey, creating a “snapping” action that increases its hunting success. This\nadaptation is especially useful in the deep sea where prey can be scarce.\nHow big do goblin sharks typically get?\nGoblin sharks can grow to considerable sizes. The largest recorded specimen measured over 6 meters\n(20 feet) in length. Most observed individuals, however, are typically between 3 and 4 meters (10 to 13\nfeet).\nIs the goblin shark dangerous to humans?\nGoblin sharks are not considered dangerous to humans. They live in deep-sea environments far from\nhuman activity. There have been no recorded attacks on humans, and their diet primarily consists of\ndeep-sea fish, crustaceans, and cephalopods.\nHow long do goblin sharks live?\nThe lifespan of goblin sharks is currently unknown due to the difficulty in studying these deep-sea\ncreatures. More research is needed to determine their longevity.\nWhere can I see a goblin shark in person?\nSeeing a goblin shark in the wild is extremely rare. However, preserved specimens are sometimes\ndisplayed in natural history museums. Your best bet is to look for museum exhibits with deep-sea\nspecimens or to follow research expeditions.\nWhat are the biggest threats to goblin sharks?\nThe biggest potential threat to goblin sharks is incidental capture in deep-sea fisheries. They can\nbecome entangled in fishing gear targeting other species. Habitat degradation in deep-sea\nenvironments could also pose a threat.\nHow many goblin sharks are estimated to be in existence?\nIt is impossible to estimate the population size of goblin sharks with any certainty. Their deep-sea\nhabitat and infrequent sightings make population assessments extremely challenging. Their rarity\nemphasizes the need for conservation efforts.\nWhat is the goblin shark’s closest living relative?\nThe goblin shark is the only extant member of the Mitsukurinidae family. While it doesn’t have any close\nliving relatives, its fossil record reveals connections to other extinct shark lineages.\nDo goblin sharks have any natural predators?\nDue to their deep-sea habitat, goblin sharks likely have few natural predators. Larger deep-sea sharks\nor marine mammals might occasionally prey on them, especially juveniles, but this has not been directly\nobserved.\nWhat is unique about the goblin shark’s snout?\nThe goblin shark’s snout is covered in electroreceptors called ampullae of Lorenzini. These receptors\nallow it to detect the faint electrical fields produced by prey, even in the complete darkness of the deep\nsea.\nHow often are goblin sharks caught or sighted?\nGoblin shark sightings and captures are infrequent. They are usually caught accidentally as bycatch in\ndeep-sea fisheries. Each sighting is valuable for scientific research.\nWhat happens to a goblin shark if it is brought to the surface?\nBringing a goblin shark to the surface can be stressful and potentially harmful to the animal.

People across the political\nspectrum once gleefully targeted so-called Karens, a term meant to denigrate women — usually white\nand middle-aged — caught using their privilege to bend the world in their direction. And the use of\nAWFUL emerged well before Ms. Good was killed. Conservative critics began attaching it to female\nprotesters at least as far back as last summer.\nThe acronym so scandalized the New York Times that it even tattled to the Department of Homeland\nSecurity about it and its growing popularity. “I’m more concerned with facts on the ground than I am\nabout acronyms,” DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told the paper in a text message.\nThe Times leaned heavily on academic experts to medicalize and psychologize conservative criticism\nof affluent white liberal women, transforming political disagreement into pathology.\nBut for the broader core of Mr. Trump’s followers, the description of white, urban women as violent\nradicals obstructing mass deportations seems to reflect older anxieties around race, gender and\nimmigration among the white, non-college educated men who make up the core of Mr. Trump’s\nmovement and perceive their place in society slipping, said Dr. Shauna Shames, a political scientist at\nRutgers and co-editor of the book “The Right Women: Republican Party Activists, Candidates, and\nLegislators.” […] Liberal academics have been diagnosing what they see as the problem. Laura K.\nField, author of the book “Furious Minds: The Making of the MAGA New Right,” said social,\ndemographic and economic changes had left men with a sense that they have lost status. “Women are,\nfor many of them, the place holder for their ‘stolen’ status,” she asserted.\nWhile the Times objects to calling affluent white female urban liberals what they are, it recently\npublished opinion pieces comparing ICE to a “secret police” and portraying Trump as a fascist. In the\npast week, the paper has published columns demeaning Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)\nas “a Virtual Secret Police” and accusing the agency of “Waging War on Blue Cities,” framing routine\nenforcement as an attack on liberal opposition. Columnist Michelle Goldberg also described Trump’s\nactions as textbook fascism .\nAfter years of using terms like “Nazi” and “fascist” against Trump and Republicans, the paper’s outrage\nover AWFUL rings hollow. The acronym simply states observable demographic and ideological facts.\nAffluent, white, female, urban, and liberal are not slurs. Yes, the acronym is clever, but its implied\ncriticism is far milder than the relentless, extreme rhetoric the New York Times has long published\nagainst the right, particularly President Trump."}

These scents, often used in conservation efforts, provide insights into the\ncomplex olfactory world of these magnificent creatures.\nThe Olfactory World of the Tiger\nTigers possess an extraordinary sense of smell, far more acute than that of humans. This heightened\nolfactory ability is crucial for survival, allowing them to locate prey, navigate their territory, and\ncommunicate with other tigers. Understanding what scents attract tigers is therefore paramount for\nconservation and research.\nKey Attractants: Prey, Social Cues, and Territory\nWhat scents attract tigers? can be broadly categorized into three primary groups: scents related to\nprey, scents for social communication, and scents used for marking territory.\nPrey-Related Scents: The scent of potential meals is a powerful attractant. Deer urine Pig scent Goat\nsecretions\nThe scent of potential meals is a powerful attractant. Social Communication Scents: Tigers use scent\nmarking to communicate, leaving messages for other tigers in their territory. Tiger urine (especially from\nother tigers) Anal gland secretions Scratch marks (leaving scent traces)\nTigers use scent marking to communicate, leaving messages for other tigers in their territory. Territorial\nMarking Scents: Related to social scents but focused on boundaries. Tiger urine Feces Glands on\npaws leave scent with each scratch\nRelated to social scents but focused on boundaries.\nThe Science Behind the Attraction\nTigers have a highly developed vomeronasal organ (VNO), also known as Jacobson’s organ, located in\nthe base of their nasal cavity. This organ specializes in detecting pheromones and other chemical\nsignals. When a tiger encounters a scent, the molecules bind to receptors in the nasal cavity and VNO,\ntriggering a neural response that travels to the brain. The brain then interprets the scent and elicits an\nappropriate behavioral response, such as approaching the source of the scent or marking their territory.\nThis neurological pathway is fundamental to what scents attract tigers.\nPractical Applications of Scent Lures\nUnderstanding what scents attract tigers has several practical applications:\nCamera Trapping: Wildlife researchers use scent lures to attract tigers to specific locations, allowing\nthem to capture images and videos for population monitoring and behavioral studies.\nWildlife researchers use scent lures to attract tigers to specific locations, allowing them to capture\nimages and videos for population monitoring and behavioral studies. Conservation Efforts: Scent lures\ncan be used to guide tigers away from human settlements and towards protected areas, reducing\nhuman-wildlife conflict.\nScent lures can be used to guide tigers away from human settlements and towards protected areas,\nreducing human-wildlife conflict. Capture and Relocation: In some cases, scent lures are used to\ncapture and relocate tigers that pose a threat to humans or livestock.\nIn some cases, scent lures are used to capture and relocate tigers that pose a threat to humans or\nlivestock. Studying Tiger Behavior: Researchers can use specific scents to study territoriality, mating\nbehavior, and predatory strategies.\nCommonly Used Scents and Their Effectiveness\nThe effectiveness of different scents can vary depending on the individual tiger, its age, sex, and social\nstatus. Here is a brief overview of commonly used scents and their known effectiveness:\nScent Effectiveness Notes ————————–\n—————————————————————————– ———————————————————\n————————————————————————————————————————————\nDeer Urine Highly effective for attracting tigers to potential prey locations. Widely used in camera\ntrapping studies. Pig Scent Effective, particularly in areas where wild pigs are a common prey item.\nOften used in conjunction with deer urine. Tiger Urine (from others) Highly effective for triggering\nterritorial responses and investigation. Careful sourcing is crucial to avoid disease transmission. Can\nevoke aggressive responses. Anal Gland Secretions Effective for communication and marking territory.\nCan be difficult to obtain and preserve. Synthetic Scents (e.g. Calvin Klein Obsession) Surprisingly\neffective in some instances; the specific chemical composition driving this is still debated. Some\nsynthetic scents mimic compounds found in animal secretions and pheromones. Success varies among\nindividual tigers and regions.\nFactors Influencing Scent Attraction\nSeveral factors can influence what scents attract tigers in a given situation. These include:\nEnvironmental Conditions: Wind direction, humidity, and temperature can affect the dispersal and\npersistence of scents.\nWind direction, humidity, and temperature can affect the dispersal and persistence of scents. Individual\nVariation: Tigers, like humans, have individual preferences and sensitivities to different scents.\nTigers, like humans, have individual preferences and sensitivities to different scents. Physiological\nState: A tiger’s hunger level, reproductive status, and overall health can influence its response to\ndifferent scents.\nA tiger’s hunger level, reproductive status, and overall health can influence its response to different\nscents. Habituation: Repeated exposure to the same scent lure can lead to habituation, reducing its\neffectiveness over time.\nRepeated exposure to the same scent lure can lead to habituation, reducing its effectiveness over time.\nSeasonality: During mating season, scents related to reproduction (urine, pheromones) become\nespecially powerful attractants.\nEthical Considerations in Scent Lure Usage\nWhile scent lures can be valuable tools for conservation and research, it’s crucial to use them ethically\nand responsibly. Overuse of scent lures can disrupt natural behaviors, alter territorial boundaries, and\npotentially increase the risk of human-wildlife conflict. Therefore, adherence to strict protocols and\nguidelines is essential when using what scents attract tigers for any purpose.\nFuture Directions in Scent Research\nOngoing research continues to unveil new insights into the olfactory world of the tiger. Scientists are\nusing advanced techniques, such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, to identify the specific\nchemical compounds that trigger different behavioral responses. This knowledge will lead to the\ndevelopment of more effective and targeted scent lures, further enhancing our ability to monitor,\nprotect, and understand these magnificent creatures.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWhat role does the vomeronasal organ (VNO) play in a tiger’s ability to detect scents?\nThe vomeronasal organ (VNO), or Jacobson’s organ, is a specialized sensory organ that detects\npheromones and other non-volatile chemical signals. This organ is crucial for tigers in detecting scents\nrelated to social communication, such as mating cues and territorial markings, playing a critical role in\ntheir behavior.\nHow does the environment affect the effectiveness of scent lures?\nEnvironmental factors such as wind, humidity, and temperature significantly impact the dispersal and\npersistence of scent lures. Wind carries the scent, humidity can either enhance or degrade it, and\ntemperature can affect the rate of evaporation. Understanding these factors is crucial for optimizing the\nplacement and timing of scent lure deployment.\nAre synthetic scents as effective as natural scents in attracting tigers?\nThe effectiveness of synthetic scents varies. Some, like Calvin Klein Obsession, have shown surprising\nsuccess, likely due to containing chemical compounds that mimic natural pheromones. However,\nnatural scents, particularly those related to prey or other tigers, generally tend to be more reliably\neffective.\nCan habituation occur with scent lures, and if so, how can it be prevented?\nYes, tigers can become habituated to scent lures if exposed repeatedly to the same scent in the same\nlocation. To prevent habituation, rotate the type of scent used, vary the location of scent lure\nplacement, and use the lures sparingly.\nWhat are the ethical considerations when using scent lures to attract tigers?\nEthical considerations include avoiding overuse of scent lures, which can disrupt natural behaviors and\nalter territorial boundaries. Scent lures should be used responsibly and in accordance with established\nguidelines to minimize negative impacts on tiger populations and their environment.\nHow can I tell if a scent lure is working effectively?\nEffectiveness can be gauged through direct observation (if safe) or, more commonly, through camera\ntrapping. An increase in tiger activity around the scent lure location indicates that it is working\neffectively. Track visitation rates and behavior near the lure site.\nIs it safe to approach a location where a scent lure has been deployed?\nIt is strongly advised NOT to approach areas where scent lures have been deployed. Tigers are apex\npredators and can be unpredictable, especially when attracted to a scent they perceive as a potential\nfood source or territorial threat. Maintaining a safe distance is essential.\nWhat type of scents are most effective for attracting female tigers?\nFor female tigers, scents related to potential mates or those indicating the presence of other female\ntigers (for territorial defense) can be particularly effective, especially during the breeding season. Urine\nfrom a male tiger in estrus can be a powerful attractant.\nAre there any scents that tigers actively avoid?\nWhile research is still ongoing, evidence suggests that tigers may avoid scents associated with danger\nor unpleasant experiences, such as strong human scents or the scent of larger predators. However,\naversion responses vary depending on the individual tiger and the context.\nHow long does a scent lure typically remain effective?\nThe effectiveness of a scent lure depends on environmental conditions, the type of scent used, and the\napplication method. Some scent lures may only remain effective for a few days, while others may last\nfor several weeks. Regular monitoring and replenishment are essential.\nCan the age of a tiger influence its response to different scents?\nYes, age can play a role. Younger tigers, lacking experience, might be more cautious or less\nresponsive to certain scents. Older tigers, particularly those establishing territories, might react more\nstrongly to territorial markers or prey scents.\nWhat is the role of scent marking in tiger communication, and how do they do it?\nScent marking is crucial for tiger communication, serving as a way to establish territories, attract mates,\nand communicate dominance. They use urine, feces, and secretions from anal glands to leave their\nscent on prominent objects, such as trees and rocks. They may also leave visible markings such as\nscratches."}

This is why we are here to take our partnership to new\nheights,” said von der Leyen, after the At Home ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhavan.She added display of\nthe flags of EU, EU Military Staff and its maritime missions ATALANTA and ASPIDES at R-Day was a\npowerful symbol of the deepening security cooperation between the two sides. “It will culminate\ntomorrow in the signing of our security and defence partnership.”EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas\nalso attended the parade that displayed, among others, Russian designed weapon systems — T-90\ntanks, BrahMos missiles and S-400 air defence system. As it looks to seal the trade deal with India,\nBrussels has in past few months cut down on the rhetoric on India’s ties with Russia and said it’s\nlooking to forge a reliable partnership with Delhi that’s anchored respect for each other’s security\nconcerns. “There is strong momentum for closer cooperation with India... At the summit, we will take\nour ties forward by signing the EU-India Security and Defence Partnership,” he said."}

It sees supply running ahead of demand by more than 2.8 million barrels a day\nthis year, with the excess peaking above 3.5 million barrels a day during the current quarter.Estimates\nbased on OPEC figures, in contrast, suggest a market that's much closer to being balanced, with\nsupply exceeding demand by about 600,000 barrels a day on average this year.The latest forecasts\nreaffirm the positions of the three agencies, which have long held widely differing views on oil market\nbalances.Neither OPEC nor the IEA forecasts OPEC production, so those future imbalances require\nassumptions to be made.In its report, the IEA uses the current OPEC+ output agreement as a proxy for\nfuture supply, and the same basis has been applied to OPEC figures to generate the chart above,\nassuming production for the three countries outside the agreement - Iran, Libya and Venezuela -\nremain steady at about the 5.4 million barrels a day seen in December.A large part of the different\noutlooks can be attributed to the agencies’ views on oil demand and growth.At just under 105 million\nbarrels a day, the IEA’s demand forecast for 2026 is about 1.5 million barrels a day below that of\nOPEC. The gap has slowly narrowed since August, with the IEA increasing its forecast by 540,000\nbarrels a day over the past five months, while the OPEC view has remained unchanged.The IEA’s\nmore optimistic view comes as a result of what it foresees as a normalization of economic conditions\nafter turmoil caused by actual and threatened tariffs impacted consumption in 2025.It now expects\nconsumption to increase by 930,000 barrels a day in 2026, but that’s still only about two-thirds of the\ngrowth seen by analysts at OPEC. The EIA’s growth outlook lies midway between the two.But the\ndivergence isn’t just in the strength of growth this year. It also reflects deep-seated historical\ndifferences.The OPEC analysts see oil demand growing at an annual average rate of 1.3% since 2023,\nbroadly in line with the long-term growth rates seen before the Covid-19 pandemic. The EIA sees a\nslightly lower growth rate of 1.2% a year. That’s led to a widening for the gap between the EIA’s and\nOPEC’s views of demand, which has increased from about 1.2 million barrels a day for 2023 to 1.7\nmillion barrels a day for this year.The divergence between OPEC and the IEA is starker. From demand\nestimates for 2023 that are just 200,000 barrels a day apart, the gap has widened to more than 1.5\nmillion barrels a day for 2026. The IEA sees consumption rising at an annual average rate of 0.9%\nbetween 2023 and 2026 — well below the historical average.All three agencies continually revise their\ndemand forecasts and even their assessments of historical consumption."}

Shelton won 3-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 in 2 hours and 36 minutes inside Rod Laver Arena, firing\n55 winners, including 14 aces, and winning 83% of his first serves.\nIt's Shelton's third-straight Australian Open quarterfinal appearance and his fourth second-week\nappearance in the last five Grand Slams. He plays his best tennis on the big stages and particularly\nenjoys the Australian Open for its raucous crowds.\n“I think I’m definitely a competitor, rowdy on the court,” Shelton said. “I look forward to rowdy crowds\nand down here in Australia, there is no shortage. From my first experience here playing at John Cain\n(Arena), I fell in love with this tournament. It’s one of my favourites marked off on the calendar every\nyear.\"\nBen Shelton vs. Casper Ruud\nShelton dropped the first set behind a rare double fault that allowed Ruud to take control, 3-1, and the\n13th-ranked Norwegian dominated his own service games deep into the second set. It's a position\nShelton hasn't been in all tournament, taking the first three games in straight sets, and he had his\nchances early in the match to win a break himself.\nNeed a news break? Check out the all new PLAY hub with puzzles, games and more!\nGrand Slams are a test of stamina, and Shelton's previous work meant he had plenty left in the tank to\nrebound. Ruud committed a double fault of his own down 4-5 in the second set to put the game at\n30-all, and Shelton took the next two points to even things up at one set apiece.\nA similar scenario played out in the third set. Ruud blew a 40-15 while on serve at 3-4, double-faulting\nagain and sending an errant forehand to make it 5-3, Shelton.\nNow, Shelton was cruising. He forced Ruud to four break points across his first three service games\nand finally broke through for a 4-3 lead. Only needing to hold serve twice to take the set, Shelton did\njust that, letting his power-lefty serve to the talking. He won the deciding game to love, delivering a 228\nkm/h (142 mph) serve in his second-to-last point.\nUp next for Ben Shelton at 2026 Australian Open\nShelton versus Sinner was the quarterfinal everyone expected from this section of the bracket, and\nboth players want the opportunity, albeit for different reasons. Shelton seemed untouchable in Grand\nSlams last year, except when he faced World No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz and No. 2 Sinner, who holds an 8-1\nadvantage in the head-to-head matchup.\nSinner ended Shelton's run in the semifinals at the 2025 Australian Open, and the American is hoping\nfor a better outcome in the rematch. The Italian wants to win every Major there is and is often in a\nposition to do it. For now, Shelton is not the threat Novak Djokovic and Alcaraz are. But that could all\nchange on Tuesday.\n“It’s what you look forward to most in this sport,” Shelton said of the upcoming match. “It’s where I\nwanted to be. I wanted to be back here. I wanted to give myself another shot, improve on some things I\ndidn’t do as well last year, and leave it all out on the court.”\nShould Shelton win, he'll face the winner of Djokovic versus Lorenzo Mussetti, both ranked inside the\ntop 5. The other semifinal will be between the winners of Carlos Alcaraz-Alex de Minaur and Alexander\nZverev-Learner Tien.\nBen Shelton's world ranking, official points\nShelton entered the first grand slam of the 2026 season as the No. 7 player in the world and the\ntop-ranked American with 4,000 official points.\nHe opened the season with a quarter-final appearance at the ATP Auckland 250. He went 1-1 in the\ntournament, losing to then-World No. 39 Sebastian Baez. However, Shelton made it one round further\nin the event than he did in 2025, earning him 40 points.\nWith that said, Shelton stands to lose a large amount of points in Melbourne after making it to the\nsemi-final of the 2025 Australian Open. Semifinalists earn 720 points in Grand Slam events, and\nShelton would have to beat Sinner in the quarter-finals to get there. A loss to Sinner would mean a\n360-point dip.\nFacebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions."}

The post Return to Silent Hill director wants to return for a sequel, but should\nhe? appeared first on JoBlo.\n\nTwenty years after first bringing Silent Hill to the big screen, director Christophe Gans has returned with\nReturn to Silent Hill, a new installment loosely inspired by the franchise’s iconic second game.\nUnfortunately, the reception hasn’t been kind, with both critics and fans largely underwhelmed by the\nlatest trip to the fog-shrouded town. Even so, Gans doesn’t appear discouraged, even saying he’d love\nto come back for a Return to Silent Hill sequel.\nChristophe Gans Wants More Silent Hill\n“ If I have the opportunity, we’ll come back to ‘Silent Hill’ once more, ” Gans told Variety. “ I’m not\nlooking at ‘Silent Hill’ only as a great video game. I’m looking at it as a piece of modern art. It has\nsomething really edgy and experimental. I will adapt another chapter because there are some that are\nextremely good, something very different from the first film, and now ‘Return to Silent Hill.’ I like this\nworld, and I can see that plenty of people are thinking I’m doing a pretty good job. “\nAdapting an iconic video game is challenging at the best of times, and Gans recalled actually receiving\ndeath threats when he tackled the first movie in 2006. “ It was a big challenge to adapt correctly and\nrespectfully a game which is considered a classic, ” he said. “ We know that the people who love video\ngames are very passionate. I remember when I did the first film, I received plenty of death threats.\nPeople were saying, ‘If you mess up this one, we are going to find you.’ So I came onto the first film\nwith great responsibility, and certainly even more with the second one. At the same time, it was\nimportant for me to imagine a movie that people who are not playing games can be interested in. “\nAs I write this, Return to Silent Hill stands at 17% on Rotten Tomatoes with a 29% Popcornmeter rating.\nNot great, but the original film didn’t receive many positive reviews either and has since become\nsomething of a cult favourite.\nWe Were Mixed on Return to Silent Hill\nOur own Tyler Nichols was a big fan of the original, and although he enjoyed the new movie, it wasn’t\nquite what he’d hoped for. “ I’m not sure Return quite lands in the way that it intends to, ” he wrote. “ It’s\na little cornier and cheaper than I would have liked. The acting can be a bit hammy, and it genuinely\nfeels like I’m playing a video game at various points. But I still found myself invested in the story and\nenjoying James’ journey. This is certainly a lot better than Revelation, but it falls short of the 2006 film.\nIts messaging is a bit dark, and I’m not sure everything comes together in the end, but I enjoyed the\njourney itself. ” You can check out the rest of his review right here.\nAlso, be sure to watch our interviews with Christophe Gans, as well as stars Hannah Emily Anderson\nand Evie Templeton.\nShould Return to Silent Hill get a sequel?"}

At the end of\nDecember, the EU’s gas inventories were almost 64% full. As of last Friday, these inventories were at\nbelow 46%—an unusually low level for this time of the year.\nOn top of Europe’s winter, January weather has manifested in the United States as well, leading to\nsoaring electricity demand—and higher natural gas prices because it’s gas, along with coal and, in the\nnotable case of New England, oil, that are covering the spike in demand. Per the Energy Information\nAdministration, natural gas prices have jumped from $3 per million British thermal units to over $7 per\nmmBtu in a matter of days, when a lot of traders expected them to move lower or at least stay around\n$3 per mmBtu.\nU.S. natural gas prices booked gains of as much as 70% last week, Bloomberg reported this weekend,\nnoting this jump came on the heels of a weekly price rise of 30% in Europe—all while traders both in\nEurope and the United States were betting on cheaper gas. This means they are losing money, and it\ncould be only the beginning—because the weather forecasts include the possibility of an extended cold\nspell in gas-producing parts of the United States, including the possibility of even lower temperatures\nthat, according to Bloomberg, could freeze gas pipelines, interfering with supply to power generators.\nBesides freezing pipelines, however, winter would also push international gas prices even higher.\nRelated: U.S. Natural Gas Prices Hit $6 For First Time Since 2022 amid Big Freeze\nTraders who spoke to Bloomberg explained that the situation with gas prices was aggravated by the\nGreenland spat between the U.S. president and European leaders, as the prospect of a conflict drove\nall energy commodity prices higher. Gas traders who had shorted the commodity rushed to cover their\npositions, contributing to the price spike. Now, more short covering may be coming because it seems\nthe bearish sentiment had a firm hold on the gas market.\n“Everyone’s in panic mode right now,” Paul Phillips, senior strategist for gas-trading company Uplift\nEnergy Strategy, told Bloomberg. “People were writing off winter last week.” This is an interesting\nremark, seeing as last week was the beginning of January, historically one of the coldest months in the\nNorthern hemisphere. Yet a couple of warmer-than-usual winters appeared to be enough to convince a\nlot of people trading gas that all winters from now on will be exactly as warm—and shorter than usual.\nApocalyptic global warming “no more snow in Europe” predictions also helped swing the sentiment into\nbearish territory.\nThe situation could deteriorate further both in terms of prices and in terms of supply—to Europe. Most\nof Europe, as grouped in the EU, has developed a heavy dependence on imports of liquefied natural\ngas from the United States. In fact, these imports have been breaking record after record—until the\nflows weakened in the past couple of weeks, likely because of the squeeze that domestic U.S. gas\nprices were putting on LNG exporters’ margins. So, Europe started draining its gas storage at the\nfastest pace in five years.\nThe front-month Dutch TTF Natural Gas Futures, the benchmark for Europe’s gas trading, jumped by\n30% since the start of January, from $34 (29 euros) per megawatt-hour on January 2 to as much as\n$45.40 (38.65 euros) per MWh on January 23. LNG cargo arrivals, meanwhile, have been at less than\nhalf of the daily volumes withdrawn from storage.\nThe gas price situation is not about to get a quick resolution, even if the weather lets up in both Europe\nand the United States. Europe would still have to refill its now fast-emptying gas storage. The United\nStates is seeing substantial electricity demand growth from the tech sector, and that will not change\nonce winter ends. In other words, the demand side of the gas equation suggests higher prices for\nlonger—and that suggests that gas traders may be in for more losses.\nAs to when and how the gas market would rebalance, this remains an open question—not least\nbecause there is not much gas storage capacity in the U.S.—the world’s largest gas exporter. “It’s like a\nheavier and heavier person jumping on a trampoline,” the chief executive of gas producer BKV Corp.\ntold Bloomberg. “You’re going to get more and more volatility.”\nBy Irina Slav for Oilprice.com\nMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com"}

That’s\ncertainly the case for the young people in three films world premiering in the World Dramatic\nCompetition at this year’s Sundance. There’s 14-year-old misfit Sid in “Big Girls Don’t Cry,” who is\ncoming-of-age in New Zealand during the mid-2000s while also coming face-to-face with internalized\nhomophobia. From Cyprus, there is “Hold Onto Me,” in which 11-year-old Iris attempts to reconnect\nwith her estranged father. Lastly, there is “Tell Me Everything,” which centers on 12-year-old Israeli\nBoaz, who, during the height of the paranoia during the early days of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s,\ndiscovers a secret about his father that will alter the course of both of their lives.\nMentored through Jane Campion’s film program A Wave In The Ocean, writer-director Paloma\nSchneideman’s “Big Girls Don’t Cry” is a wry and intimate queer coming-of-age tale filled with as much\ndesire as it has rebellion. Set in the summer of 2006, the film centers on Sid (Ani Palmer, in a\nwonderfully layered and subtle debut performance), an angsty youngster as she navigates that uneasy\nspace between childhood and what lies beyond. You’ll cringe with painful recognition as Sid tries on\ndifferent identities as she interacts with different people, like piercing her own belly button to impress\nthe vapid hot girls she desperately wants to think she’s cool. Or trying pot for the first time with Freya\n(Rain Spencer, always a breath of fresh air), an exchange student from America who already knows\nSid is cool. While she tests the boundaries of youthful recklessness, Sid also pushes away her older\nsister, her childhood best friend, and her less-than-stellar Dad (Noah Taylor).\nAs horrified as I am that the mid-2000s have now been used as a period setting by at least a dozen\nfilms in recent memory (“Saltburn,” “Suncoast,” and “Yes, God Yes” to name a few), it’s interesting to\nsee what details directors will choose to evoke the era. Here it’s Von Dutch trucker hats and MSN\nMessenger chats, both of which must feel as ancient to younger viewers now as bellbottoms did to me\nwatching films made in the 1990s that were set in the 1970s.\nBut what really makes this film special is the way Schneideman subtly indicates how painful it was in\nthat era to grow up queer without any real support system, even if you never experienced any actual\nviolence. Sid has not quite accepted her queerness, partially because of the era’s rampant\nhomophobia, and partially because she doesn’t seem to have any queer elders to guide her. This, of\ncourse, adds to her confusion as she explores her sexuality. In one of the film’s funniest visual\nmoments, Sid masturbates alone in her room, looking at a poster of hot beach bodies on the wall, her\neye slowly moving past the ripped dudes before holding steady on a girl in a bikini. I laughed, but I also\nsaw a reflection of my own struggle as a weird little queer girl coming-of-age on my own in the middle of\nnowhere in this same era.\nChristos Passalis and Maria Petrova appear in HOLD ONTO ME (Κρ■τα Με) by Myrsini Aristidou, an\nofficial selection of the 2026 Sundance Film Festival. Courtesy of Sundance Institute | photo by Lasse\nUlvedal Tolbøll.\nWhile Sid is working to get comfortable in her own skin, 11-year-old Iris, the spunky protagonist of\nCypriot writer-director Myrsini Aristidou’s debut feature film “Hold On To Me,” is already there. She’s a\nher older best friend Danae (Jenny Sallo), so the two could sunbathe and record TikTok dances. She\neven resists pressure to reveal the name of her accomplice. She’s equally tough when her estranged\nfather Aris (Hristos Passalis) bilks her pocket money to pay off the boat’s owner when he’s called to the\nstation to retrieve her. Determined to get her money back, and also clearly longing to reconnect with\nher long-lost Dad, Iris follows him around town until he lets her in on his schemes. Yes, the film gets\ninto some “Paper Moon” territory, but Aristidou takes those building blocks and transforms them into a\nstory that is uniquely her own.\nIris adores her father, and we see how their personalities reflect each other, both in the moments when\nthey are together and in Iris’ private moments, like when she mimics his cigarette smoking while alone\nin her bathroom. While Aris is at first gruff with his daughter, his hidden tenderness slowly surfaces. My\nfavorite scene in the film features Aris sharing one his favorite songs, the Alan Parsons Project banger\n“Eye In The Sky,” with his daughter while the two cruise in his car. Sharing music with each other was a\nlove language I also shared with my late father, so I’m not going to lie, I got a little misty-eyed.\nOf course, their newfound closeness swiftly becomes threatened by the ghosts of Aris’ past, in the form\nof some underworld baddies. You might think you know how the events of this last act will unfold, but\nAristidou’s film finds new paths to forge, and I found myself holding my breath more than once as I\nwatched these two work through the hurdles that life throws at them. I also enjoy a filmmaker bold\nenough to end her film without any traditional closure. More of that, please.\nA still from Tell Me Everything by Moshe Rosenthal, an official selection of the 2026 Sundance Film\nFestival. Courtesy of Sundance Institute | photo by Ziv Berkovich\nMoshe Rosenthal’s sophomore feature “Tell Me Everything” also centers on a fragile close parent-child\nrelationship and the perils of homophobia. In the first half of the film, we follow 12-year-old Boaz as he\nand his family prepare for his Bar Mitzvah in the mid-1980s, when big hair and new wave pop music\ndominate the airwaves. In fact, this marked the second film I saw at Sundance in which characters\nbond over listening to music in their car (in this case, the Jim Steinman-penned Air Supply ballad\n“Making Love Out of Nothing at All”).\nAs the film begins, Boaz has a close relationship with both his parents, adoring his glamorous mother,\nBella (Keren Tzur), and idolizing his father, Meir (Assi Cohen). He even has a loving, if somewhat fitful,\nrelationship with the teenage sisters (Mor Dimri, Neta Orbach) with whom he shares a bedroom. That\nis, until one day at the pool, he discovers his father’s hidden second life hooking up with men. Due to\nthe fearmongering around AIDs in the media, which Rosenthal peppers in like poisonous white noise in\nthe background, Boaz is fearful that his father’s indiscretion has put the whole family in danger of\ncatching the disease, and he begins acting out.\nTheir close-knit family fractures in the wake of this discovery, and the second half of the film, set in the\n1990s, centers on broken pieces. Anger and resentment, as well as violent homophobia, fester under\nBoaz’s skin, coming to a head one night when he and his friends cruise a queer pickup spot. Their\nmisadventure turns violent when Boaz spits on a gay sex worker, an action that will have greater\nramifications for Boaz later on in the film. I won’t spoil the ending, but I will say I almost wish the film\nhad ended with Boaz’s comeuppance, rather than the prickly, but ultimately tidy ending that Rosenthal\ngrants him."}

Superhero comics love to use time travel in a variety of ways, and the men\nand women of X have had some of the wildest time travel stories ever. The team’s time-traveling tales\nmade the dystopian future into a major part of the comic industry, and have helped set up one of the\nmost trustworthy tropes in fiction: someone from a bad future coming back to stop it. The X-Men did this\nyears before The Terminator made it popular, and as time went on, we’ve gotten more stories like this.\nSometimes, it’s worked, and sometimes it’s failed.\nVideos by ComicBook.com\nMarvel’s merry mutants have had some of the best time travel stories, but they’ve also had some of the\nworst. Their best time travel stories are some of the most amazing in comic history, and their worst are\nlegendary stinkers. Here are ten of the most notable X-Men time travel stories, ranked from worst to\nbest, a collection of stories that fans love and hate.\n10) “Age of Revelation”\nImage Courtesy of Marvel Comics\n2024 marked the end of the Krakoa Era (which could probably be on this list, because of how important\ntimey-wimey stuff is to it), with a new group of editors taking over. 2025 was the 30-year anniversary of\n“Age of Apocalypse”, so readers got “Age of Revelation”. This story saw Cyclops and Beast sent to a\nterrible future ruled by Revelation, the heir of Apocalypse, and fans just didn’t connect it whatsoever.\n“Age of Revelation” failed in numerous ways, although the aftermath might turn out well, so that’s a\nplus.\n9) “Battle of the Atom”\nImage Courtesy of Marvel Comics\nAfter the unfairly maligned Avengers vs. X-Men, the original five X-Men were brought to the present,\nwhich led to “Battle of the Atom”. This story ran through Wolverine and the X-Men, All-New X-Men,\nUncanny X-Men, andX-Men, as well as two bookend issues. It saw a group of the X-Men from the\nfuture come back to the present to convince the team to send the O5 back to the past, but the whole\nthing gets really complicated, really fast. This story had a fine structure and wasn’t all that confusing,\nbut it just never came together. This is what happens when four very different creative teams have to\ntell a story. It’s not a terrible story, but it’s also not a great one.\n8) “Days of Future Present”\nImage Courtesy of Marvel Comics\n“Days of Future Past” is the most important X-time travel story ever, and has had a huge effect on the\ncomic industry. Since the story dropped, its future has become almost canon, with more of the events\nbeing fleshed out because of characters like Rachel Summers. In 1990, Marvel decided to put out\n“Days of Future Present”, which revolved around Franklin Richards, both in the present and the future,\nas Ahab comes to the present to attack the members of the X-Men, New Mutants, and the Fantastic\nFour. This story was taking place in the transitional period where writers Chris Claremont and Louise\nSimonson were being pushed out, and it’s very much an all style, no substance type of story.\n7) X-Factor (Vol. 1) #65-68\nImage Courtesy of Marvel COmics\nApocalypse was first introduced as the big bad of X-Factor (Vol. 1), with the villain and the team\nclashing numerous times. Their final battle took place in X-Factor (Vol. 1) #65-68, by Chris Claremont,\nJim Lee, and Whilce Potracio. A mysterious figure from the future comes to the present just as\nApocalypse kidnaps Nathan Summers, leading to Apocalypse’s first (and coolest) death. Nathan is sent\nto the future, infected by a techno-organic virus by En Sabah Nur, to save his life. This story is very\nmuch ’90s cheese, so it’s not exactly great, but the art is good, and it has some awesome moments. It\ndoesn’t really stand up in 2026, but it’s still pretty okay.\n6) The Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix\nImage Courtesy of Marvel Comics\nThe Adventures of Cyclops and Phoenix, by Scott Lobdell and Gene Ha, was a sequel of sorts to\nX-Factor (Vol. 1) #65-68. Published in the wake of X-Men (Vol. 2) #30, the wedding of Cyclops and\nJean Grey, it followed the two heroes after they are pulled into the future by Mother Askani (their\n“DoFP” daughter Rachel who came back to become Phoenix II and eventually went into the future) to\nhelp raise and protect Nathan Summers, the future Cable, from the forces of Apocalypse. This story is\npretty average. Lobdell can be both a great and terrible writer, and this story is basically in the middle of\nthe quality scale. Ha’s art is cool, but he wasn’t as good as he would be in the future. All in all, it’s a\nstory that you’ll enjoy reading, but it’s not all that memorable.\n5) “Age of Apocalypse”\nImage Courtesy of Marvel Comics\n“Age of Apocalypse” is a legendary story, and is beloved by many fans. One of the most interesting\naspects of the story is that it’s an alternate universe story and a time travel tale, all in one. After Xavier\nwas killed in the past, a new universe was created where Apocalypse takes over the Americas and\nstarts war with humanity, with only Bishop remembering the old world. He eventually joins up with the\nX-Men, under the leadership of Magneto, and the group hatches a plan to go back in time and stop\nXavier’s death at the hands of his son. People love this story, but if we’re being honest, not all of it is\ngreat. While time travel plays a part in the ending, the amount of actual time-traveling in it is small, but it\nstill counts.\n4) “Past Lives”\nImage Courtesy of Marvel Comics\nOld Man Logan (Vol. 2) was one of the best books of a bad era of X-Men, as writer Jeff Lemire told a\nstory of Logan getting used to the present and the changes to his life. Lemire’s final story on the book\n“Past Lives” saw Logan try to stop the events that caused him to kill the X-Men by time travel, powered\nby the magical villain Asmodeus. However, the villain instead sends him back in time and tries to sell\nhis body. It’s a trip through the history of the character, and Lemire and artist Eric Nguyen do a fabulous\njob with the story, an emotional journey that changes Logan forever.\n3) “Here Comes Tomorrow”\nImage Courtesy of Marvel Comics\nGrant Morrison’s New X-Men is legendary. It definitely lived up to its name, as the writer took the\nstandard tropes of the team and used them in new ways. That extended to the final story of their run,\n“Here Comes Tomorrow”, with artist Marc Silvestri. This story took place a hundred years after New\nX-Men #150. The Earth has been ruined by the Beast of the Apocalypse, with a small team of X-Men\ngetting their hands on the Phoenix Egg in hopes of using Jean Grey to save everything. However,\nBeast is able to get his hands on it, with the team making a final desperate effort to defeat him.\nMorrison is in rare form here, their massive imagination coming up with one of the best alternate futures\never. Silvestri is also at his best, giving readers a time travel story that sowed the seeds for one of the\nX-Men’s greatest relationships.\n2) “Legion Quest”\nImage Courtesy of Marvel COmics\n“Legion Quest” was a truly epic time travel story. The four-part tale run through Uncanny X-Men and\nX-Men, by Scott Lobdell, Fabian Nicieza, Andy Kubert, Roger Cruz, and Ron Garney, and told the story\nof Legion wanting to fix his life. However, the method he chooses is to go back in time and kill Magneto,\nblaming the master of magnetism for the problems Xavier had, which kept father and son apart. Storm,\nBishop, Jean Grey, Psylocke, and Iceman are pulled with him, and do their best to stop him. This story\nhits on all cylinders, giving readers the kind of drama and action that they crave. It’s an important part of\nX-Men history, quality storytelling that set the stage for one of its most popular stories.\n1) “Days of Future Past”\nImage Courtesy of Marvel Comics\n“Days of Future Past” changed comics forever. Chris Claremont and John Byrne’s classic time travel\ntale took readers to a future where the war between mutants and humans took a terrible turn, with the\nSentinels in control of the world. The X-Men send Kate Pryde back in time to stop their future from\nhappening, as the team in the future battled the Sentinels in a final effort. If you like dystopian future\nsuperhero stories, you can thank the popularity of this story for it. This is a classic, with great writing\nand gorgeous art. It’s an amazing piece of work, and one of the high points of Claremont and Byrne’s\ntime together.\nWhat is your favorite X-Men time travel stories?

Transmission of rate cut only half complete in public sector banks\nIndia’s monetary policy transmission varied sharply across banks, between February and November\n2025. After the RBI cut repo rates by 100 basis points, foreign banks passed on the full reduction to\nboth fresh and outstanding rupee loans, while private banks transmitted about three■fourths. Public\nsector banks were the slowest, cutting lending rates by only 54 bps on fresh loans and 59 bps on\noutstanding loans, mainly due to heavy reliance on MCLR-linked loans. Deposit-rate transmission was\nstronger for fresh deposits, with foreign banks reducing rates by over 100 bps. However, outstanding\ndeposit rates fell far less across all bank groups.\n2. India’s PMO urges Finance Ministry to accelerate agricultural growth via co-operatives, FPOs\nThe PMO has asked the Finance Ministry to accelerate agricultural growth as the sector’s expansion\nhas slowed from 4.6% in 2024–25 to 3.1% in 2025–26. The upcoming Budget is expected to boost the\nrural economy by strengthening cooperatives, FPOs, post■harvest infrastructure and agro■processing\nto raise farmer incomes and jobs. Despite record foodgrain output, agriculture’s GVA share has fallen\nto 17.7%, with climate events like La Niña and El Niño disrupting production. Allied sectors, especially\nlivestock, remain strong contributors. With over 8.5 lakh cooperatives, the government aims to scale\nvalue■addition and expand agricultural exports ahead of another El Niño year.\n3. Markets eye capex push, steady fiscal math in Budget run-up\nIndian markets enter the Budget expecting steady fiscal consolidation and a continued capex push.\nInvestors anticipate the FY27 fiscal deficit in the low■4% range, around 4.3% of GDP, with gross\nmarket borrowing staying high at about ■16 lakh crore due to heavy redemptions and infrastructure\nspending. This supports sentiment for capital■goods, construction, metals and infra stocks, with limited\nspace for broad consumption stimulus. Markets also expect targeted support for export■oriented\nsectors, manufacturing incentives and possible tax relief for sovereign funds. Industry seeks simpler tax\nrules, ESOP taxation deferral for start■ups, and real■estate■linked relief, including updated norms for\nAIFs and tokenisation.\n4. BIS norms to weed out mis-selling in lab-grown diamond market, says industry\nLab-grown diamonds are gaining strong acceptance beyond India’s traditional hubs, with Greenlab’s\nnew Ayodhya store generating ■30–40 lakh in monthly sales. The shift comes as BIS introduces\nmandatory disclosure norms requiring jewellers to clearly label lab-grown diamonds, specify production\nmethods like CVD or HPHT, and prevent mis-selling. Industry players say the rules will boost\ntransparency and trust, as lab-grown diamonds, priced nearly 90% lower than natural ones, attract\nyounger buyers. Greenlab, now India’s largest exporter of lab-grown diamonds, expects demand to\naccelerate. Meanwhile, exports of both natural and lab-grown diamonds remain subdued amid global\nslowdown.\nPublished on January 27, 2026"}

All proceeds\nfrom the sale will go to charity.\n\nThe Chevrolet C8 Corvette ZR1X is turning heads in more ways than one.\nOver the weekend, a one-of-a-kind Stars & Steel example of “America’s Hypercar” sold for $2.6 million\nat Barrett-Jackson’s annual Scottsdale sale. The stunning hammer price, all of which will go to charity,\nis more than 12 times what the range-topping version of the vehicle normally costs.\nThe ‘Vette in question is a special version of the 1-of-250 Stars & Steel variant announced last month\nas part of Chevrolet’s celebration of the U.S.’s 250th birthday. This example, unlike the less exclusive\nedition, has been hand-painted in custom Dark Satin Steel with blue accents (including on the brake\ncalipers and rear wing) and features a Santorini Blue interior. Untouched is the 5.5-liter\ntwin-turbocharged V-8 that makes 1,250 hp and 828 ft lbs of torque. The variant can rocket from zero to\n60 mph in 1.68 seconds, making it the quickest American production car of all time.\nAll proceeds from the sale will go to the Tunnel to Towers Foundation. Chevrolet\nThe winning bidder was NASCAR team owner Rick Hendrick, who paid $2.6 million for the patriotic\nCorvette. Chevy hasn’t announced how much the Stars & Steels variant costs, but the “standard” ZR1X\nstarts at $207,395. That means the motorsports executive paid more than 12 times the sticker price for\nhis car. It also makes Hendrick’s car one of the most expensive Corvettes of all time. The priciest is the\none-off 1957 SS Project XP-64, which sold for $7.7 million. The most expensive C8, meanwhile, is the\nfirst ZR1 example, which the exec bought for $3.7 million in last summer.\nWATCH\nAll of the proceeds from Hendrick’s latest ‘Vette will go to the Tunnel to Towers Foundation. The charity\nis focused on eradicating veteran homelessness and provides mortgage-free houses to affected\nfamilies and builds smart homes for injured heroes.\nThe standard 2026 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1X Stars & Steel Chevy\n“To honor those who serve, Chevrolet created a 1-of-1 edition of America’s quickest production car, the\nCorvette ZR1X,” said Scott Bell, Global Chevrolet vice president, said in a statement. “We’re proud to\nknow the winning bid will go directly to supporting first responders and veterans in need across the\nUnited States through the Tunnel to Towers Foundation.”\nLast week, news broke that Chevy is thinking about building more limited-run, few-off, and bespoke\nCorvettes. This weekend’s auction may have had the added draw of helping out a good cause, but it\nalso shows that there are deep-pocketed enthusiasts out there eager to spend big on special editions of\nthe C8.\nClick here for more photos of the one-off Chevrolet Corvette ZR1X Stars & Steel.\nChevrolet"}

In 1980, Sly and Robbie formed their own record label\ncalled Taxi Records, releasing albums by a number of other Jamaican bands.\nWorking With Rock Artists\nIn addition to their own solo work through the '80s,'90s and into the 21st century, the duo appeared on\ncountless albums by rock, jazz and pop artists, including but not limited to Bob Dylan's Infidels and\nEmpire Burlesque, Mick Jagger's She's the Boss, the Rolling Stones' Undercover (at one point, Sly and\nRobbie opened for the Rolling Stones on tour), Joe Cocker's Sheffield Steel, Serge Gainsbourg's\nNegusa Nagast, Jackson Browne's World in Motion, Yoko Ono's Starpeace, Carly Simon's Hello Big\nMan, Sinead O'Connor's Throw Down Your Arms and many others.\nEven with the number of artists coming to Sly and Robbie for their talent, Dunbar noted in interviews\nover the years that he never felt as though anyone was stealing away their sound.\n\"A lot of people said 'they’re taking our music,' but I never think of that,\" he said to Berklee Online. \"To\nus we know it's reggae, and so we felt good to know somebody is liking what we’re doing and coming in\nand doing covers, using our beat, and everything.\"\nDunbar was a 13-time Grammy-nominee and the winner of two of those awards. His musical partner\nShakespeare passed away in 2021.\nWhen asked in a 2020 interview what he'd like to be remembered for, Dunbar replied: \"Making some\ngreat records, being in some great groups, playing some nice drum patterns, starting reggae all over.\nJust because I've been reading that what I'm playing makes you just want to dance, you just want to get\nto the club, this is what I'm all about.

The deal makes Rodman the highest-paid player in\nNWSL history and, per her agent Mike Senkowski, the highest-paid women’s soccer player in the world.\nThe announcement was made at an event in Los Angeles alongside Spirit owner Michele Kang and\nclub executives, while Rodman continues training with the USWNT.\nMORE: Athlete cult favorite Jack in the Box announces 75th anniversary streetwear drop\n“It feels amazing. I’m very happy, I’m very blessed,” Rodman said after signing. “I think it’s a\nmonumental and game-changing moment right now.” She added that the deal aligns with her long-term\nvision, calling it “perfect timing with the World Cup happening in the U.S.”\nThe agreement closes a chaotic chapter that began when Rodman’s previous contract expired on Dec.\n31. Despite being the league’s most recognizable star, she entered the offseason without a deal,\nfueling speculation that she could leave the National Women's Soccer League entirely. Sources\nindicated that top clubs abroad — particularly in England — had made lucrative offers that Washington\ncould not match under the league’s salary cap, which stood at $3.5 million per team in 2025.\nIn late November, Rodman and the Spirit reportedly reached a creative four-year agreement that would\nhave averaged more than $1 million per season. That proposal was later rejected by the league, with\ncommissioner Jessica Berman ruling that it violated league rules. The NWSL also accused Rodman of\nattempting to circumvent the cap, prompting the NWSL Players Association to file a grievance on her\nbehalf, calling the intervention a violation of the collective bargaining agreement.\nAs the standoff intensified, the league’s board of governors approved a new High Impact Player (HIP)\nrule in December, allowing teams to exceed the salary cap by up to $1 million for certain star players.\nSpirit president of soccer operations Haley Carter confirmed that Rodman’s new contract benefited\nfrom the implementation of that rule.\n“Not only me personally but all of us at the Spirit are profoundly grateful that she has chosen to stay\nwith us,” Kang said, referencing the “very compelling alternatives” Rodman had elsewhere.\nMORE: Ex-NFL QB Kellen Mond roasts former head coach: 'Leadership is an atmosphere you create'\nRodman, drafted second overall by Washington in 2021, helped deliver the club’s first NWSL\nchampionship as a rookie and has remained its centerpiece ever since."}

A class action lawsuit has already\nbeen filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than March 16, 2026.\nA lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the\nlitigation.\nWHY ROSEN LAW: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success\nin leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any\nmeaningful peer recognition. Many of these firms do not actually litigate securities class actions, but are\nmerely middlemen that refer clients or partner with law firms that actually litigate the cases. Be wise in\nselecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its\npractice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm has achieved,\nat that time, the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company. Rosen Law\nFirm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action\nsettlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered\nhundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for\ninvestors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs’ Bar.\nMany of the firm’s attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers.\nDETAILS OF THE CASE: According to the lawsuit, defendants provided investors with material\ninformation concerning Vistagen’s plan to develop and commercialize its drug fasedienol, an\ninvestigational pherine candidate in development for the acute treatment of social anxiety disorder\n(SAD). Defendants’ statements included, among other things, Vistagen’s positive assertions of\nfasedienol’s future trial success based on the prior positive results associated with the PALISADE-2\nclinical trial, in addition to notable enhancements and operational changes made to the execution of the\nPALISADE-3 clinical trial supported a strong likelihood of Phase 3 success and positioned it as a\nconfirmatory study.\nAccording to the lawsuit, defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors\nwhile, at the same time, disseminating false and misleading statements and/or concealing material\nadverse facts concerning its Phase 3 PALISADE-3 trial study of fasedienol. When the true details\nentered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages.\nTo join the Vistagen class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=50827 or call\nPhillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for information on the class\naction.\nNo Class Has Been Certified.

Leprosy is a fully curable disease when treated with the\nWHO-recommended multi-drug therapy. However, for over two years, Nigeria has experienced a\ncritical shortage of these essential medications, despite their procurement and donation through official\nWHO-approved channels.”\nThe dermatologists revealed that regulatory and administrative delays had prevented the clearance and\ndistribution of the donated drugs, leaving vulnerable patients without access to life-saving treatment.\nThey stated, “Regulatory and administrative delays have prevented clearance and distribution, leaving\npatients in multiple states without access to life-saving treatment. It is reported that the Clean Report of\nInspection and Analysis certificate, required by NAFDAC to ensure and certify quality before clearance\ninto Nigeria, has not been provided by the drug manufacturers.”\nThe association warned that the consequences of the treatment interruption were severe, emphasising\nthat a cure was impossible without access to medication.\nThe statement noted, “The consequences of this interruption are severe. Where treatment is\nunavailable, cure is impossible. Untreated leprosy leads to progressive nerve damage, disability,\ndeformities, preventable complications, and continued community transmission. These outcomes\ndirectly reinforce stigma, exclusion, and long-term socioeconomic harm to affected individuals and\nfamilies and increase the risk of community transmission.”\nThe dermatologists emphasised that stigma associated with leprosy could not be eliminated without\nensuring access to effective medical treatment.\nThey argued, “NAD emphasises that stigma does not exist in isolation. It is sustained by systemic\nfailures in access to care. Without timely treatment, disease progression leads to visible disability,\nwhich fuels discrimination and social marginalisation. Ending stigma, therefore, requires not only social\nchange, but guaranteed access to effective medical treatment.”\nThe association referenced recent Nigerian research highlighting the persistent burden of leprosy in the\ncountry.\nThe statement said, “Recent Nigerian research, including a 17-year retrospective study published in the\nClinical and Experimental Dermatology Journal titled ‘Demographic and clinical profile of patients with\nleprosy in Lagos, Nigeria,’ highlights the persistent burden of leprosy, patterns of disability, and the\nurgent need for strengthened treatment access and disease control systems.”\nThe Nigerian Association of Dermatologists called for urgent regulatory intervention to facilitate the\nclearance and release of WHO-donated multidrug therapy.\nThey demanded, “Urgent regulatory intervention to facilitate clearance and release of WHO-donated\nMDT, high-level inter-agency collaboration to resolve administrative bottlenecks, immediate restoration\nof treatment access for patients nationwide, and sustained systems to prevent future supply\ndisruptions.”\nThe association stressed that leprosy elimination could not be achieved without treatment, and stigma\ncould not end without treatment and cure.\nThe statement concluded, “Leprosy elimination cannot be achieved without treatment. Stigma cannot\nend without treatment and cure. Cure cannot occur without drugs. Access to essential medicines is a\npublic health obligation, a human rights issue, and a national responsibility.”\nEfforts to obtain the reaction of NAFDAC through its Resident Media Consultant, Sayo Akintola, were\nunsuccessful as of press time, as he had yet to respond to messages and questions sent to him on\nWhatsApp.."}

It begins in Seattle in 2016 — a simpler,\nsunnier time. But as is often the case in the city itself, ominous storm clouds can quickly gather. In this\ncase, those clouds gathered when Microsoft began to explore using an AI chatbot (they named it “Tay”)\nwhich could “interact” with people on Twitter.\nWithin a day, the chatbot turned into a Nazi, gobbling up all the hateful trash on the Internet and\nvomiting it back up. Microsoft shut the chatbot down, but, as Veatch’s documentary establishes, this\nopened a Pandora’s Box. “Ghost in the Machine” says it doesn’t have to be this way.\nWhat follows this pointed opening is a whirlwind of an experience that grapples with urgent historical\nand sociological questions underpinning the technology. Veatch moves rapidly between interconnected\ntopics in a way that is exhilarating, although for some it could be overwhelming. Her film comes out of\nthe gate at confident, breakneck speed and never slows down.\nThe film argues that there is no time to waste, and it rises to meet the moment. Veatch won’t be\nintimidated by the “ghost in the machine” and is instead like a one woman Scooby-Doo mystery gang,\nunmasking the fantasies that surround these ghosts for being what they are: an extension of\ntechno-fascism.\nWhile this could be didactic or tiresome in the wrong hands, “Ghost in the Machine” has a playful edge\nthat keeps you riveted. Veatch is on a crusade, intent on exposing the costly lies we are being told\nabout AI. But her film and its many fascinating and knowledgeable experts make their arguments with\nsuch compelling verve and sharp analysis that only the most self-serving of AI evangelists would deny\nthe intellectual rigor.\nWhere everything else about AI in our present moment seems built on desperate hype, Veatch cuts\nthrough all the noise to wake us up from this nightmare. Though she never herself makes an\nappearance, her fearless film makes her a Michael Moore for our hyper-online world.\nThe film does stumble a bit in some moments when Veatch leans into using AI herself. While these\nsequences highlight how ugly and nightmarish the technology can be, they don’t always feel necessary.\nUsing the tools of AI against itself can only go so far.\nYou’re willing to cut Veatch some slack to explore this, and there’s a strange, dark irony to seeing\nAI-generated graphics depicting data centers consuming our world. At the same time, it’s hard not to\nfeel as if this could have been made by an actual artist to be more ideologically consistent, given that\nthe film is endorsing a rejection of AI.\nThis small hang-up aside, “Ghost in the Machine” breaks through all the BS being spun about AI with\nclear-eyed, compassionate care. It pulls no punches, taking worthwhile swings at Elon Musk and the\nsinister Silicon Valley that gave rise to men like him. It diagnoses the sickness that is consuming\nhumanity’s soul and doesn’t shy away from the damage this will cause.\nHowever, just as critically, it provides the knowledge needed to open up pathways to pull the world in a\nbetter direction.\nCheck out all our Sundance coverage here"}

From the moment we\nwake up to the time...\n\nCharging phones and portable devices has become one of the most routine actions of modern life.\nFrom the moment we wake up to the time we go to sleep, our devices depend on reliable power. We\ncharge at home, in offices, cafés, airports, hotels, libraries, and public transportation spaces. Despite\nhow frequently charging occurs, the physical environments designed to support it often feel like an\nafterthought. Wall sockets are commonly placed low to the ground, behind furniture, under desks, or in\nnarrow corners that were never designed with daily device use in mind.\nAs a result, charging cables are routinely forced into uncomfortable positions. They are bent sharply\nagainst walls, twisted sideways, or compressed between furniture and outlets. Over time, this repeated\nstress causes visible wear. The outer insulation begins to tear, internal wiring weakens, and charging\nreliability declines. Many users replace cables not because they stop working suddenly, but because\ngradual damage makes them unsafe or frustrating to use. This cycle creates unnecessary waste,\nfinancial cost, and ongoing inconvenience.\nDesigner: Berkan Sunayol\nBeyond annoyance, damaged charging accessories raise genuine safety concerns. Continuous\npressure on the adapter and cable can degrade electrical contact points, increasing the risk of\noverheating, inconsistent power delivery, or short circuits. In public and shared environments, where\nusers may not notice early signs of damage, this becomes an overlooked safety issue.\nCharging cables are intentionally designed to be flexible. They allow users to route them around\nobjects, across surfaces, and through tight gaps. Charging adapters, however, remain rigid and stiff.\nThis mismatch creates a critical point of failure. When a rigid adapter is plugged into an awkwardly\nplaced socket, it locks the cable into a fixed angle. The cable is forced to bend sharply at the connector,\nwhich is often the weakest part of the entire system.\nOver time, this rigidity undermines the durability of both the cable and the adapter. Despite widespread\nawareness of cable damage, most existing solutions focus on reinforcing the cable itself rather than\naddressing the adapter that causes the stress.\nThe Flexible Charge Adapter addresses this issue by rethinking the adapter as an adaptive component\nrather than a static block. A stretchable silicone structure is integrated into a specific section of the\nadapter, allowing controlled flexibility where it matters most. This design introduces a small but\nmeaningful bend that aligns naturally with the direction of the cable.\nIn tight or awkward spaces, this flexibility reduces sharp angles, minimizes pressure at the connection\npoint, and allows the cable to rest in a safer, more natural position. The adapter responds to real-world\nconditions instead of resisting them, helping preserve the integrity of the cable and the safety of the\ncharging process.\nIn addition to improving durability and safety, the adapter also supports modern usage patterns. With\ntwo charging ports, users can charge multiple devices at the same time, even in confined\nenvironments. Phones, earbuds, power banks, and other accessories can be powered simultaneously\nwithout crowding the socket or straining cables.\nThe Flexible Charge Adapter demonstrates how thoughtful design can address everyday frustrations\nthat are often overlooked. By introducing flexibility into a traditionally rigid object, it extends the life of\ncharging accessories, reduces safety risks, and improves the overall charging experience. In a world\nwhere charging is constant and unavoidable, this design makes a simple act safer, smarter, and more\nsustainable."}

A Deep Dive into Aquatic Speed\nThe question of which is faster swordfish or sailfish? has captivated marine enthusiasts for years. The\nanswer, unequivocally, is the sailfish, capable of bursts of speed exceeding 68 mph, making it one of\nthe fastest fish in the ocean.\nThe pursuit of understanding the speed capabilities of marine life is more than just a point of trivia; it\nunlocks insights into their hunting strategies, predator avoidance tactics, and overall evolutionary\nadaptations. Both swordfish and sailfish are remarkable creatures, but their approaches to speed and\nagility differ significantly.\nBackground: The Contenders\nBefore diving into the specifics of their speeds, it’s essential to understand the characteristics of each\nfish:\nSailfish: Belonging to the Istiophoridae family, sailfish are characterized by their prominent dorsal fin,\nwhich resembles a sail. They are primarily found in warmer parts of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.\nSwordfish: Belonging to the Xiphiidae family, swordfish are easily recognizable by their long, flat bill (or\nsword). They have a wider distribution, inhabiting both temperate and tropical waters.\nAssessing Aquatic Speed: Methodology and Challenges\nDetermining the exact speed of marine animals presents several challenges. Scientists employ various\nmethods, including:\nTagging and Tracking: Attaching electronic tags that record speed data.\nAttaching electronic tags that record speed data. Direct Observation: Observing and estimating speed\nbased on distance covered over time.\nObserving and estimating speed based on distance covered over time. Modeling: Using hydrodynamic\nmodels to predict speed based on body shape and muscle power.\nHowever, it’s crucial to acknowledge the limitations of each method. Tagging can affect a fish’s\nbehavior, direct observation is prone to inaccuracies, and models are only as good as the data they are\nbased on.\nFactors Influencing Speed\nSeveral factors contribute to a fish’s top speed:\nBody Shape: Hydrodynamic body shapes reduce drag and improve efficiency.\nHydrodynamic body shapes reduce drag and improve efficiency. Muscle Mass and Type: The\nproportion of red (endurance) vs. white (burst) muscle fibers determines speed and stamina.\nThe proportion of red (endurance) vs. white (burst) muscle fibers determines speed and stamina. Fin\nStructure: Fin shape, size, and flexibility influence propulsion and maneuverability.\nFin shape, size, and flexibility influence propulsion and maneuverability. Water Temperature:\nMetabolism and muscle performance are affected by water temperature.\nSwordfish Speed: A Powerful Predator\nSwordfish are powerful and impressive predators. While not as fast as sailfish in short bursts, they\npossess considerable strength and endurance.\nCruising Speed: Swordfish typically cruise at a moderate speed, conserving energy for hunting.\nSwordfish typically cruise at a moderate speed, conserving energy for hunting. Burst Speed: They are\ncapable of short bursts of speed to overtake prey, estimated at around 50-60 mph.\nThey are capable of short bursts of speed to overtake prey, estimated at around 50-60 mph. Hunting\nTechnique: Swordfish use their bill to slash at prey, often stunning or injuring them before consumption.\nSailfish Speed: The Aquatic Sprinter\nSailfish are renowned for their exceptional speed, making them arguably the fastest fish in the ocean.\nBurst Speed: Sailfish can reach speeds exceeding 68 mph, allowing them to capture incredibly\nfast-moving prey.\nSailfish can reach speeds exceeding 68 mph, allowing them to capture incredibly fast-moving prey. Sail\nDeployment: Their distinctive dorsal fin (sail) may play a role in stabilization or even propulsion during\nhigh-speed chases.\nTheir distinctive dorsal fin (sail) may play a role in stabilization or even propulsion during high-speed\nchases. Hunting Technique: Sailfish often hunt in groups, using their speed to herd and isolate prey.\nSpeed Comparison: Head to Head\nA side-by-side comparison highlights the key differences in speed capabilities:\nFeature Swordfish Sailfish —————– —————————————— —————————————–\nMax Speed ~ 50-60 mph > 68 mph Body Shape More robust, less streamlined More streamlined,\noptimized for speed Hunting Style Stalking, slashing High-speed pursuit Muscle Fiber Type Balanced\nred and white Higher proportion of white muscle fibers\nConclusion: Sailfish Takes the Crown\nWhich is faster swordfish or sailfish? While both are impressive predators, the sailfish reigns supreme\nwhen it comes to speed. Its streamlined body, powerful tail, and potentially the unique “sail,” combine to\ncreate an aquatic sprinter unmatched by the swordfish. The swordfish compensates with its formidable\nweapon and powerful build, proving speed isn’t everything in the underwater world.\nFAQ Section\nHow accurate are the speed measurements of sailfish and swordfish?\nSpeed measurements are estimates derived from various methods, each with inherent limitations.\nTagging studies provide valuable data, but tags can affect a fish’s behavior. Observation is prone to\nerror, and models depend on accurate data input. Therefore, the reported speeds are approximations\nbased on the best available science.\nDoes the size of a swordfish or sailfish affect its speed?\nYes, size can influence speed. Larger fish generally possess more muscle mass, which can translate to\ngreater power and potential for higher speeds. However, extremely large size can also increase drag,\noffsetting some of the advantage.\nWhat role does the sailfish’s dorsal fin play in its speed?\nThe exact role of the sailfish’s dorsal fin is still debated. Some scientists believe it functions primarily as\na stabilizing rudder during high-speed chases, preventing the fish from yawing. Others suggest it might\neven contribute to propulsion, acting as a sail in certain conditions.\nDo swordfish and sailfish compete for the same prey?\nYes, to some extent. Both swordfish and sailfish consume a variety of fish and squid. However, their\nhunting strategies and preferred habitats differ, reducing direct competition. Swordfish tend to hunt\ndeeper and target larger prey, while sailfish often hunt in shallower waters and pursue smaller,\nfaster-moving prey.\nCan a swordfish’s “sword” affect its speed?\nWhile the “sword” isn’t used for propulsion, it can impact hydrodynamics. The streamlined shape of the\nbill likely reduces drag, allowing the swordfish to move efficiently through the water. However, the\nprimary function of the bill is to wound or kill prey, not enhance speed.\nAre sailfish the fastest fish in the ocean overall?\nSailfish are considered among the fastest fish in the ocean, but the title isn’t definitively settled. Other\ncontenders include marlin and some species of tuna. Measurement challenges and variations in\nindividual performance make precise comparisons difficult.\nWhat adaptations do swordfish and sailfish have for deep-sea diving?\nSwordfish have adaptations for deep-sea diving, including specialized brain and eye heaters that allow\nthem to function in cold, dark environments. Sailfish, generally, do not dive as deep as swordfish.\nHow does water temperature affect the speed of these fish?\nWarmer water increases metabolism, which can enhance muscle performance and potentially increase\nspeed. However, excessively high temperatures can also lead to fatigue and reduced performance.\nDo sailfish and swordfish use their speed for purposes other than hunting?\nWhile hunting is the primary driver of speed, both sailfish and swordfish may use speed to escape\npredators or to navigate long distances during migration.\nHow do scientists track the speed of swordfish and sailfish in their natural habitat?\nScientists use electronic tags that record depth, temperature, and speed. These tags are attached to\nthe fish and either transmit data wirelessly or are recovered later to retrieve the information.\nHow does the muscle composition of swordfish and sailfish contribute to their speed differences?\nSailfish possess a higher proportion of white muscle fibers, which are designed for short bursts of\nspeed. Swordfish have a more balanced mix of red and white muscle fibers, providing both speed and\nendurance.\nAre there any ongoing studies that are further exploring the speeds of these animals?\nYes, ongoing research continues to explore the speed capabilities and hunting strategies of swordfish\nand sailfish. Scientists are using advanced tracking technology and hydrodynamic modeling to gain a\ndeeper understanding of these remarkable creatures."}

One speaks to the woodland\nhabitat—Shulin, the forest itself. The other is a gentle phonetic echo of “neighbor,” suggesting that we\nare not masters of nature, but temporary lodgers in the home of our living surroundings. This project\nbegins with a simple stance: architecture does not possess the land; it borrows it. To “borrow” is to\napproach the site with humility—to practice respect, hospitality, and shared stewardship, and to affirm\nvalues of sustainability and symbiosis.\nAt retirement, the homeowners—having completed a full and successful chapter—chose to return to\ntheir birthplace and settle into a quieter cadence of life. In a valley in central Taiwan, they acquired a\nlong, slender hillside parcel, imagining a refuge for two: a secluded dwelling woven into forest and\nmountain air. The site is shaped by two terraces at different elevations: an open clearing above, and,\nbelow, a grove held close by trees. Beyond, distant ridgelines draw a wide horizon; nearby, the forest\noffers an intimate ecology of bark, frond, and shade.\nThe design ambition was to dissolve the frontier between building and landscape—so that living here is\nnot merely an act of viewing scenery, but of entering it, inhabiting it, and—quietly—becoming part of its\ncomposition.\nConcept\nHorizontal Frames of Horizon · A Vertical Promenade Among Trees\nThe house is composed through a dual sensibility—one still, one moving:\nHorizontal (Static / Visual) A language of long, quiet horizontals is drawn across the façade and interior\nedges—lines that gather the valley’s vastness. Like a handscroll painting, the architecture frames\ndistant mountains and roaming mists, inviting them indoors as if they were suspended in air. The\npanorama is not simply seen; it is kept—a seasonal archive of light, weather, and time.\nVertical (Dynamic / Experiential) A cantilevered corridor threads through the woodland, hovering lightly\nso that ferns and understory life may continue to breathe and grow beneath. Movement becomes a\nritual: light splintering through branches, breezes playing along the passage, rain sifting down to scatter\npetals into a soft, ephemeral carpet. Here, the corridor is not a corridor alone—it is a garden walk, an\necological procession, a slow choreography of the body in dialogue with the forest.\nA Section Written as a Story\nThe building is read vertically as a narrative of rooting, stitching, and dwelling:\nB1 — Rooted Interlocked with the hillside retaining wall, the lower level becomes the house’s root\nsystem—quietly anchoring it to the slope. It connects to exterior movement and holds the tools of a life\nclose to the earth: gardening implements, farming equipment, and hiking gear—an inventory of\neveryday wilderness.\n1F — Sutured Aligned with the upper terrace, the first floor is the shared realm—both living space and\nconnective hinge. It sutures the macro of distant ridges with the micro of nearby trunks and fronds. A\nlarge-span glass curtain wall dissolves enclosure, letting the day pass through like a slow\ntide—sunlight, cloud-shadow, dusk—each moment gently rewriting the room.\n2F — Inhabited At the highest point, the primary bedroom and rooftop terrace form a quiet belvedere.\nHere the valley opens into weather and sky: constellations, cloud seas, and the soft breathing of the\nlandscape—received not as spectacle, but as daily companionship.\nThe Light-Filtering Stair To preserve the horizon line, the stair is organized by a vertical “contour” logic,\nwith consistent risers and a porous construction. Light and shadow pass through it as through a sieve,\nbecoming fleeting frames—nature distilled into geometry.\nFrame · Corridor · Bridge\nThis house is, at once, a frame for the far mountains, a corridor that wanders with the trees, and a\nbridge that restores contact between human life and the living world. It steps back with restraint,\nallowing wind, light, rain, and green to take the foreground.\nHere, time is no longer measured by clocks. It is sensed through the turning of leaves, the migration of\nshadow, and the forest’s unhurried pulse—moving quietly, enduringly, beautifully."}

Whereas bad summer weather is always — always — and prominently blamed on our\nburning fossil fuels.” OK: One CNN piece cited “expert” claims “that ‘severe winter weather events are\nstill possible — and perhaps even more likely’ because of global warming,” but last year a Bloomberg\npiece quoted “climate ‘experts” claiming that ‘the long-term trend, especially in the normally colder parts\nof the U.S. and other countries, is one of warmer winters with less of the white stuff’,” while Time just\nlast month cited “climate ‘experts’ explaining how ‘climate change is causing shorter, warmer winters.’ ”\n“Whatever this is, it ain’t science.”\nCentrist: Why Credit-Card Caps Backfire\n“Not a single bank has complied” with President Trump’s call to cap credit-card interest rates at 10%,\ncheers The Free Press’ Joe Nocera. Phew: Without “the ability to impose high interest rates,” banks\nsimply wouldn’t extend unsecured credit to most people; high rates let them cover their losses as “more\nthan 19 million accounts default each year. In 2024, that amounted to $59 billion.” Under the cap, all but\nthe rich and upper middle class would “lose their cards” because banks would lose money otherwise.\nLimiting credit-card rates “won’t eliminate the need for credit,” so higher-risk borrowers would have to\nuse “payday lenders” and “loan sharks,” whose rates are truly usurious.\nCampus watch: ‘Free Speech’ Isn’t Free\n“I can tell you that ‘free speech’ isn’t free,” sighs Kristan Hawkins at RealClearPolitics. She sets up\nevents at colleges nationwide, but “manipulative schools have worked hard to develop financial and\nlogistical obstacles to student speech — from special, additional, and often last-minute insurance to\nrequirements for bomb-sniffing dogs.” Other barriers include a “religious gag rule,” endless delays,\ntrigger warnings to discourage attendance, cancellations due to fear of violence and doxxing. Her\ngroup, Students for Life of America, “has endured bomb threats, vandalizations, stolen and damaged\nproperty, physical attacks, urine throwing, stalking, student doxxing, and general cruelty.” And “threats\nof rape and murder are common.” Without better support, “many will be priced out of the public arena.”\n— Compiled by The Post Editorial Board"}

Gavin\nJoint Innovation Outpost is an investment in that future, where we will develop and test cutting-edge\ncapabilities while forging enduring new partnerships with the best of the military, industry, and\nacademia to meet the future head on.”\nWhile the U.S. Army currently collaborates with industry through the Assistant Secretary of the Army for\nAcquisition, Logistics and Technology office, the JIOP represents the first concerted effort to focus on\nrapid innovation coordinated with industry and academia at the operational level. The JIOP will connect\nSoldiers from all ranks and levels to innovative teams capable of developing solutions for current\nbattlefield challenges.\n“Every piece of technology we develop at the JIOP has one ultimate purpose: to enhance the lethality\nand survivability of our Soldiers on the battlefield,” said Col. Thomas Monaghan, director of the Joint\nInnovation Outpost. “This is about ensuring our warfighters can dominate any adversary, anywhere in\nthe world.”\nIn addition to addressing modern battlefield problems, the JIOP will foster and strengthen ties between\nFort Bragg and regional academic and industrial partners. “At the JIOP, we are creating a dynamic\necosystem where our Soldiers can collaborate directly with the brightest minds in industry and\nacademia,” said Anderson. “This partnership is essential for accelerating innovation and maintaining\nour competitive edge.”\nIn recent years, Fort Bragg and the XVIII Airborne Corps have led the way in Soldier innovation through\nevents like Dragon’s Lair and exercises such as Scarlet Dragon. Dragon’s Lair is a competition similar\nto Shark Tank, where Soldiers pitch innovative technological solutions that range from battlefield\napplications to improvements in daily quality of life. Scarlet Dragon involves industry partners field\ntesting new technologies with the XVIII Airborne Corps and its subordinate units.\nLooking ahead, Dragon’s Lair will feed the JIOP with innovative ideas, which will then flow into Scarlet\nDragon for testing, creating a quick, tri-series process to rapidly address challenges for Soldiers in\nmodern and future combat environments. “Fort Bragg has always been a proving ground for Army\ninnovation, and the JIOP is the next chapter in that legacy,” added Monaghan.\nMAJ Matthew St. Clair"}
